## The Core Equation of Empirical Non-Duality
---

> **Formal Statement**

```
∀p [ Phenomenon(p) → Inseparable(p, Ω) ]
```

---

> **Definitions**

```
∃!s Substrate(s)
Ω = the unique s such that Substrate(s)
Inseparable(x, y) ⇔ ∃s (Substrate(s) ∧ Presents(x, s) ∧ y = s)
```

---

> **Interpretation**

Every phenomenon is inseparable from the one unique substrate Ω.  
All that appears is the substrate itself, presenting as appearance.  
There are not two — only One reality, expressed in many modes.
