[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/1079066681.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17388701)

## Introduction

The machine-verified formalization of non-dual ontology (DOI 10.5281/zenodo.17388701) establishes through rigorous proof that all phenomena lack intrinsic essence, are inseparable presentations of a unique substrate Ω, and arise dependently from other phenomena within that substrate. These formally proven claims have profound implications for biology and medicine, requiring reconceptualization of what organisms are, how life relates to non-life, what constitutes disease and health, how healing occurs, what death means, and how medical practice should understand its interventions in living systems. What distinguishes this from philosophical speculation about life and medicine is its character as formal mathematics, where every implication follows deductively from explicit axioms verified mechanically to be internally consistent.

The central challenge this formalization poses to biology and medicine is whether living organisms should be understood as bounded substantial entities with essential natures and clear boundaries separating them from environment, or as phenomenal presentations arising dependently from conditions with fluid boundaries and no unchanging essence. If the latter, then the entire explanatory framework of biology requires revision, organisms are not self-contained units but presentation-patterns arising from and inseparable from larger phenomenal contexts, disease is not invasion of essential health by external pathology but transformation of presentation-structure, healing is not restoration of essential nature but emergence of new presentation-patterns, and death is not annihilation of substantial entity but transformation in how substrate presents itself.

This paper examines what the axioms and proven theorems entail for understanding life, organisms, disease, health, medical treatment, and the relationship between biology and medicine when applied with logical rigor to living systems. The formalization provides no special axioms for life, living phenomena are subject to same ontological structure as all phenomena, and this generality is precisely what makes the implications so transformative.

## Organisms

Biology treats organisms as paradigmatic units of life, bounded entities with clear separation from environment, possessing essential properties that define them as members of species and as living rather than non-living. But the formalization's axiom Emptiness_of_Phenomena establishes formally that all phenomena lack essence, meaning if organisms are phenomena, which they must be as observable entities with spatiotemporal location, then organisms have no intrinsic essential nature defining them as what they are independently of context and relations.

This doesn't deny organisms exist or that they're real biological entities, it reconceives their ontological status. Organisms are phenomenal presentations, real patterns arising dependently from conditions rather than self-subsistent entities with intrinsic nature. The formalization's section on "Endogenous / Dependent Arising" establishes through axioms AF_only_pheno and AF_endogenous that phenomena arise from other phenomena, organisms arise from genetic information, developmental processes, environmental conditions, evolutionary history, and ongoing metabolic exchanges, they are not independently existing substances with essential organism-nature.

The formalization's treatment of spacetime in section "Spacetime as Representation" establishes through axiom S1_coords_only_for_phenomena that anything assignable coordinates is phenomenon. Organisms occupy spatial locations and can be assigned coordinates, they have boundaries that appear to separate inside from outside, self from environment. But these spatial boundaries are phenomenal-level distinctions rather than absolute ontological separations. The organism-phenomenon and environment-phenomenon are both presentations, their boundary is structural feature within phenomenal presenting rather than gap between separate substances.

The formalization's Nonduality theorem proving that all phenomena are inseparable from substrate Ω means organisms, like all phenomena, are presentations of substrate rather than independently existing entities. If substrate is identified with awareness or consciousness in idealist interpretation, then organisms are consciousness presenting itself in particular organized forms. If substrate is neutral stuff in neutral monist interpretation, organisms are that substrate presenting itself as living patterns. Either way, organisms are not separate from the ontological ground but rather ways that ground presents itself.

For understanding what makes something alive versus non-living, the formalization suggests this is phenomenal-level distinction based on organizational patterns rather than essential property dividing reality into living and non-living substances. Living presentations exhibit particular characteristics including metabolism, reproduction, responsiveness, organization, and evolution, but these are phenomenal patterns not essential properties. The boundary between living and non-living is gradient and context-dependent rather than absolute separation, consistent with biological findings about viruses, prions, and early life that challenge clear categorical distinctions.

The formalization's dependent arising framework means organisms continuously arise from conditions rather than persisting as unchanging substances. An organism at any moment is presentation arising from its prior state, genetic information, environmental inputs, and metabolic processes. The apparent persistence of organism through time is causal continuity among changing presentations rather than unchanging substance underlying changes. This aligns with biological understanding that organisms are processes rather than things, all molecules are replaced over time yet organism-pattern continues.

For understanding organism boundaries, the formalization's framework suggests these are phenomenal conventions useful for biological analysis but not absolute ontological facts. The human body appears bounded by skin, but skin harbors microbiome that is functionally inseparable from human metabolism, gut bacteria are phenotypically part of human digestive system, mitochondria were once independent organisms, and immune cells circulate between bodies. The organism-boundary is pragmatic abstraction for tracking certain causal patterns, not ontological separation between essentially distinct entities.

## Life

The formalization provides no special axioms distinguishing living from non-living phenomena, both are phenomena subject to emptiness axiom denying essence and Nonduality theorem establishing inseparability from substrate. This suggests life is organizational pattern in phenomenal presenting rather than special substance or essential property that some entities possess and others lack. Living presentations are characterized by particular dynamic patterns including self-maintenance, reproduction, evolution, and responsiveness, but these are phenomenal characteristics not essential life-property.

The formalization's causality axioms establishing that causation operates only among phenomena (C1_only_phenomena) as irreflexive (C2_irreflexive) and transitive (C3_transitive) pattern means living processes are phenomenal-level causal relations among presentations. Metabolism is causal pattern among chemical presentations maintaining organism-presentation, reproduction is causal pattern generating new organism-presentations from existing ones, evolution is causal pattern transforming population-presentations over time. These causal patterns are real and distinctive but don't reflect essential life-substance.

For understanding origin of life, the formalization's dependent arising framework (AF_endogenous axiom establishing phenomena arise from other phenomena endogenously) suggests life arose from non-living chemical conditions through phenomenal-level causal processes rather than requiring external life-substance or vital force. The transition from non-living to living was emergence of particular organizational patterns in phenomenal presenting, not appearance of new essential substance. This aligns with chemical evolution theories explaining life's origin through self-organizing chemical systems.

The formalization's framework challenges vitalism positing essential life-force distinguishing living from non-living, because phenomena lack essences (Emptiness axiom) so there can be no essential life-property. But it also challenges reductive materialism that would deny any significant distinction between living and non-living patterns. Living presentations exhibit distinctive phenomenal organization with particular causal dynamics, these organizational differences are real even though they don't reflect essential properties. The formalization suggests middle position where life is real phenomenal pattern without being essential substance.

For synthetic biology creating life from non-living components, the formalization suggests this involves organizing presentations into life-characteristic patterns rather than infusing life-essence into dead matter. Successfully creating minimal cell involves arranging chemical presentations to exhibit self-maintenance, reproduction, and evolution, not discovering or transferring essential life-property. The gradual nature of transitions from non-living to living chemical systems reflects phenomenal pattern-emergence rather than essential property-acquisition.

The formalization's Nonduality theorem establishing all phenomena are inseparable from substrate means living and non-living presentations both present the same substrate. Life is not separate realm requiring special ontological status but rather particular way substrate presents itself. This doesn't diminish life's significance or wonder but contextualizes it ontologically as phenomenal pattern within unified substrate-presenting.

## Boundaries

One of the most important implications for biology is the formalization's treatment of boundaries as phenomenal conventions rather than ontological absolutes. The emptiness axiom establishes phenomena lack intrinsic essence that would ground absolute boundaries, and the Nonduality theorem establishes all phenomena are inseparable from substrate, so apparent separations between phenomena are phenomenal distinctions within unified presenting rather than gaps between separate substances.

For organism-environment boundaries, this means the skin-boundary or membrane-boundary distinguishing organism from environment is phenomenal-level structural pattern rather than absolute ontological separation. The boundary serves pragmatic purposes for biology, enabling tracking of organism-patterns and their interactions, but it's conventional abstraction from more complex reality where organism and environment are intimately interdependent. Organism continuously exchanges matter and energy with environment, boundary is more like permeable interface than impermeable barrier.

The formalization's dependent arising framework establishes that organisms arise from environmental conditions and cannot exist independently of them. An organism is not self-sufficient entity that happens to interact with environment, it is pattern continuously arising from environmental conditions including nutrients, oxygen, temperature, and ecosystem context. The organism-presentation and environment-presentation are mutually arising phenomenal patterns, neither exists independently, so the boundary between them is abstraction from their interdependence rather than separation between independent entities.

For understanding symbiosis, endosymbiosis, and holobiont concepts in biology, the formalization provides natural framework. If organism boundaries are phenomenal conventions rather than ontological absolutes, then whether mitochondria are part of organism or separate organisms is conventional decision based on pragmatic purposes, not discoverable ontological fact. Human organism including gut microbiome as functional holobiont reflects biological reality that organism-presentation and microbiome-presentations are intimately coordinated, boundaries are pragmatic rather than absolute.

The formalization's framework also applies to boundaries between organisms in species and populations. Individual organisms appear distinct, but they arise from common genetic heritage, reproduce by combining genetic material, and exist within populations where their phenotypes influence each other. The boundary between individuals is real phenomenal distinction enabling tracking of particular patterns, but the distinctions don't constitute absolute separations. Population is not mere collection of separate organisms but rather phenomenal pattern with internal distinctions.

For developmental biology understanding how single cell becomes multicellular organism, the formalization suggests this involves differentiation of phenomenal patterns within arising organism-presentation rather than subdivision of essential organism-substance into distinct cell-substances. Cells in organism are phenomenal presentations arising coordinately from zygote-presentation, their apparent separateness as distinct cells is phenomenal distinction within unified organism-pattern. Cell boundaries are functional interfaces rather than absolute separations between cell-substances.

The formalization's treatment of gauge symmetry in section "Symmetry / Gauge on Phenomena" where axiom Act_pres_presentation establishes gauge transformations preserve presentation-relation suggests organism boundaries can be drawn differently for different analytical purposes without affecting what is actually presented. Describing system as single organism versus as holobiont of organism plus microbiome may be gauge-equivalent descriptions of same underlying presentation-structure, with boundary-choice reflecting analytical framework rather than ontological fact.

## Disease

The formalization's framework requires reconceiving disease as transformation of presentation-structure rather than as invasion of essential health by external pathology. The emptiness axiom establishes that organisms lack essential healthy nature that disease disrupts, health and disease are phenomenal patterns rather than essential states. An organism presenting with disease is not essentially diseased entity but rather presentation exhibiting disease-patterns arising from conditions.

The formalization's causality axioms establishing causation operates among phenomena (C1) means disease processes are phenomenal-level causal patterns. Pathogen-phenomena causally affect host-organism-phenomena, genetic-mutation-phenomena causally affect cellular-function-phenomena, environmental-toxin-phenomena causally affect tissue-phenomena. These causal effects are real and produce suffering, but they don't reflect essential disease-substance invading essential health-substance.

The formalization's dependent arising framework (AF_endogenous) establishes that disease-presentations arise from conditions including genetic predisposition, environmental exposure, behavioral patterns, social determinants, and chance events. Disease is not essential property organism acquires but rather presentation-pattern arising when conditions produce pathological organization. This shifts medical understanding from disease as thing organism has to disease as pattern organism presents arising from conditions.

For infectious disease, the formalization suggests pathogen and host are phenomenal presentations arising in causal relation rather than separate substantial entities in conflict. The infection is coordinated phenomenal pattern involving pathogen-replication-presentation and host-response-presentation, both arising from conditions. The apparent separateness between pathogen-as-other and host-as-self is phenomenal distinction, both are presentations of substrate. This doesn't mean infection is illusion or doesn't cause harm, the phenomenal pattern produces real suffering requiring intervention.

For chronic disease and degenerative conditions, the formalization's framework suggests these are transformations in organism-presentation-patterns arising from accumulated conditions including aging, environmental damage, genetic expression, and lifestyle factors. The disease-presentation is continuous with organism-presentation, not separate entity that invaded. This supports integrative approaches addressing multiple contributing conditions rather than single-cause models treating disease as discrete entity requiring specific cure.

For mental illness and psychological disorder, the formalization provides unified framework with physical disease. Both are phenomenal presentation-patterns arising from conditions, differing in whether primary phenomenal manifestations are physiological or experiential but not differing essentially. The mind-body distinction is phenomenal-level categorization, both mental and physical presentations present substrate, so mental illness is not less real or less biological than physical illness. Both reflect transformation of presentation-structure arising from complex conditions.

The formalization's framework challenges disease-entity models treating diseases as natural kinds with essential natures that medicine discovers. If diseases are phenomenal patterns rather than essential entities, then disease classification is conventional organization of phenomenal variety for pragmatic purposes rather than discovery of natural disease-essences. This accords with difficulties in disease classification where boundaries between diseases are fuzzy and diseases themselves evolve as medical knowledge and social contexts change.

For understanding placebo effects and mind-body healing, the formalization provides framework explaining how psychological factors affect physical disease without requiring dualist mind-body interaction. If both mental and physical presentations are phenomenal patterns presenting substrate, then what we call psychological factors (beliefs, expectations, stress) and what we call physical factors (immune response, inflammation, cellular function) are coordinated phenomenal patterns. Changes in one aspect of presentation-pattern affect other aspects because they're not separate substances but aspects of unified phenomenal presenting.

## Health

Health in the formalization's framework is not essential natural state that disease disrupts but rather phenomenal pattern-range that organisms present when conditions enable flourishing. The emptiness axiom establishes organisms lack essential healthy nature, health is not unchanging essence organisms possess when disease is absent. Instead, health is dynamic presentation-pattern characterized by resilience, adaptation, integrated functioning, and capacity to respond to challenges.

The formalization's dependent arising framework means health arises from conditions including genetic endowment, developmental history, current environment, social support, medical care, and behavioral choices. Health is not essential property organism has independently but pattern continuously arising from conditions. This explains why health is context-dependent and varies across individuals, contexts, and time periods, there is no single essential health-state but rather range of health-presentations arising under different conditions.

For understanding health promotion and preventive medicine, the formalization suggests focusing on conditions from which health-presentations arise rather than protecting essential health-property from disease-threats. Interventions promoting health work by altering conditions, improving nutrition-conditions, increasing exercise-conditions, reducing stress-conditions, enhancing social-support-conditions. The arising of health-presentations from improved conditions is phenomenal-level causal pattern rather than restoration of essential health-substance.

The formalization's Nonduality theorem establishing all phenomena are inseparable from substrate suggests health is not isolated individual property but arises from person's inseparability from larger contexts. Individual health depends on community health, ecosystem health, and social conditions because individuals are presentations inseparable from these larger phenomenal contexts. This supports public health and social medicine recognizing that individual health cannot be fully understood or promoted independently of social determinants.

For holistic and integrative medicine emphasizing whole-person health rather than disease-focused treatment, the formalization provides ontological foundation. If organisms are unified phenomenal presentations rather than collections of separate organ-substances, then health requires attention to whole presentation-pattern rather than just localized pathology. Physical, psychological, social, and spiritual aspects of person are phenomenal distinctions within unified presentation, all affecting overall health-pattern.

The formalization's framework also suggests that obsessive pursuit of perfect health or immortality involves reification, treating health as essential permanent state achievable through sufficient intervention. If organisms are phenomenal presentations arising from conditions and all phenomenal patterns transform, perfect unchanging health is impossible. Health is dynamic balance and resilience rather than static perfection. Aging and eventual death are inherent in phenomenal nature of organisms, not failures to achieve essential immortal health-state.

## Treatment

Medical treatment in the formalization's framework is intervention in phenomenal-level causal patterns to alter conditions from which disease-presentations arise and enable health-presentations to emerge. The causality axioms establishing causation operates among phenomena (C1) means treatment works through phenomenal-level causal effects, medications are chemical-phenomena affecting cellular-phenomena, surgery is physical-phenomena altering tissue-phenomena, psychotherapy is communicative-phenomena affecting thought-emotion-phenomena.

The formalization's dependent arising framework means treatment effectiveness depends on addressing conditions from which pathology arises rather than attacking essential disease-substance. Effective treatment changes conditions, antibiotics alter bacterial-environmental-conditions making bacterial-survival-patterns unsustainable, chemotherapy changes cellular-environmental-conditions making cancer-cell-replication-patterns difficult, physical therapy changes musculoskeletal-conditions enabling different movement-patterns. Treatment alters phenomenal conditions from which presentations arise.

For understanding treatment resistance and failure, the formalization suggests these often reflect incomplete addressing of arising-conditions. If disease-presentation arises from multiple conditions but treatment addresses only some, disease-pattern may persist or recur. Cancer returning after treatment reflects conditions enabling cancer-presentations remaining despite treatment removing existing cancer-cells. Antibiotic resistance reflects evolutionary conditions enabling resistant-bacterial-presentations to arise. Treatment requires comprehensive attention to conditioning factors.

The formalization's framework supports both reductive interventions targeting specific causal mechanisms and holistic interventions addressing multiple conditioning factors simultaneously. Both work by altering phenomenal-level conditions, neither is privileged ontologically. Antibiotics targeting specific bacterial pathways and lifestyle interventions affecting multiple physiological systems both operate through phenomenal-level causation. The choice between approaches depends on pragmatic effectiveness for particular conditions rather than essential superiority of one approach.

For understanding why similar treatments produce different results in different patients, the formalization's dependent arising framework provides explanation. Treatment-presentation interacts with patient-presentation that arose from unique developmental, genetic, and environmental conditions. The resulting phenomenal pattern depends on both treatment and patient-specific conditions. This supports personalized medicine recognizing that treatment must be tailored to individual conditioning-patterns rather than applying uniform protocols assuming patients are essentially identical.

The formalization's denial of essential disease-entities (Emptiness axiom) suggests treatment should focus on supporting organism's transformation toward health-patterns rather than attacking essential disease-substances. This supports approaches emphasizing restoration of healthy functioning and resilience rather than purely suppressive or eliminative strategies. Treatment aims to enable organism-presentation to transform toward health-patterns through changing conditions, not to remove disease-essence and reveal underlying health-essence.

For iatrogenic harm and treatment side-effects, the formalization provides framework understanding these as arising from same phenomenal-level causation as therapeutic effects. Medical interventions are phenomenal presentations affecting organism-presentations through causal patterns, these effects include both desired health-promoting patterns and undesired pathological patterns. The distinction is phenomenal-level evaluation of effects rather than essential difference between healing and harming substances. Comprehensive treatment considers full range of phenomenal effects.

## Mind-Body

The formalization's framework dissolves the mind-body problem by denying the substance-dualism that generates it. Traditional mind-body problem asks how immaterial mental substance interacts with material physical substance, but the formalization establishes that if mind and body are observable phenomena with causal effects, both must be phenomenal presentations (by exhaustivity axiom A3). Neither is substantial independent entity, both are phenomenal patterns, so there's no gap requiring bridging between separate substances.

The formalization's Nonduality theorem establishes that all phenomena including mental-phenomena and bodily-phenomena are inseparable presentations of substrate Ω. If substrate is consciousness-itself in idealist interpretation, then both mental experiences and bodily processes are presentations in consciousness. If substrate is neutral in neutral monist interpretation, then mental and bodily phenomena are dual aspects of substrate's presenting. Either way, mind and body are not separate substances but related phenomenal patterns.

For psychosomatic medicine and understanding how psychological factors affect physical health, the formalization provides framework explaining these effects without requiring mysterious mind-body interaction. Psychological-phenomena (stress, emotion, belief) and physiological-phenomena (immune function, inflammation, hormonal balance) are coordinated phenomenal patterns presenting substrate. Changes in psychological-patterns affect physiological-patterns because they're aspects of unified phenomenal presenting, not because mental substance causally influences physical substance.

The formalization's causality axioms establish causation operates among phenomena (C1), so mental-phenomena can causally affect physical-phenomena and vice versa as phenomenal-level causal relations. Stress-presentations cause cortisol-increase-presentations, chronic-pain-presentations cause depression-presentations, these are phenomenal-level causal patterns rather than interactions between separate mind-substance and body-substance. The causation is real and bidirectional, consistent with extensive evidence for mind-body interactions in medicine.

For understanding consciousness and its relationship to brain, the formalization requires reconceiving both as phenomenal presentations. If brain is phenomenon (has spatial location, observable structure) and consciousness involves observable phenomenal contents, then brain and consciousness are coordinated phenomenal patterns rather than separate substances in causal relation. The neural-correlates-of-consciousness research documents coordination patterns between brain-phenomena and experience-phenomena, both presenting substrate coordinately.

The formalization's framework supports integrative medicine treating whole person rather than separating mental and physical treatment. If mind-body distinction is phenomenal-level categorization rather than ontological separation, then optimal treatment addresses both psychological and physiological conditioning-factors simultaneously. Psychological interventions have physical effects and physical interventions have psychological effects because mind and body are phenomenal distinctions within unified presentation requiring comprehensive attention.

For understanding meditation, mind-body practices, and contemplative approaches to health, the formalization provides ontological foundation. These practices work by transforming phenomenal presentation-patterns in ways that affect both experiential and physiological aspects. Meditation altering stress-responses and immune-function reflects changes in coordinated phenomenal patterns, not mind controlling body through mysterious interaction. The practices transform conditions from which both mental and physical presentations arise.

## Healing

Healing in the formalization's framework is transformation of phenomenal presentation-patterns from disease-configurations toward health-configurations through changes in arising-conditions. The dependent arising axioms establish that presentations arise from conditions (AF_endogenous), so healing requires altering conditions to enable different patterns to arise. Healing is not restoration of essential healthy nature that disease obscured but emergence of new presentation-patterns when conditions change.

The formalization's framework explains why healing often occurs without medical intervention, because organism-presentations have inherent capacity to transform toward health-patterns when conditions permit. The immune system eliminating infections, wounds healing, broken bones knitting, all reflect phenomenal-level self-organizing patterns that arise when conditions enable them. Medical treatment supports healing by optimizing conditions rather than supplying essential healing-substance that organism lacks.

For understanding spontaneous remission of serious disease, the formalization suggests these reflect rapid transformation of phenomenal presentation-patterns when conditions change dramatically. The remission is not miracle violating natural law but rather phenomenal pattern-shift arising from changed conditions that may include immune function changes, hormonal shifts, psychological factors, environmental alterations, or stochastic processes. Because presentations lack essence and arise dependently, dramatic transformation is possible without violating identity or essential nature.

The formalization's emptiness axiom establishes organisms lack essential diseased-nature even when seriously ill, which provides ground for hope in healing without denying disease's reality or severity. Disease-presentations are real and cause genuine suffering, but they don't constitute unchanging essence. Healing is possible because presentations can transform as conditions transform, no presentation is fixed in essential unchanging pattern.

For understanding why similar injuries or diseases heal differently in different individuals, the formalization's dependent arising framework provides explanation. Healing arises from conditions including injury-severity, individual-genetic-factors, immune-function, nutritional-status, stress-levels, social-support, and behavioral-factors. Different individuals present different conditioning-patterns, so healing-presentations that arise differ. This supports individualized approaches to supporting healing rather than uniform protocols.

The formalization's Nonduality theorem establishing phenomena are inseparable from substrate suggests healing capacity is not isolated individual property but arises from person's connection to larger contexts. Social support, caring relationships, natural environments, and spiritual practices can support healing by affecting conditions from which person-presentations arise. Healing is relational process rather than purely individual biological mechanism, reflecting ontological interdependence.

For complementary and alternative medicine approaches, the formalization provides framework for understanding how diverse interventions may support healing. Acupuncture, herbal medicine, energy healing, and other approaches work by affecting phenomenal-level conditions from which presentations arise, whether through neurological, biochemical, placebo, or other mechanisms. The question is not whether approaches affect real underlying essences but whether they produce beneficial changes in phenomenal presentation-patterns.

## Death

Death in the formalization's framework is transformation of organism-presentation rather than annihilation of essential organism-substance. The emptiness axiom establishes organisms lack essential unchanging nature that death would destroy, organisms are phenomenal presentations arising continuously from conditions. When conditions no longer support life-characteristic patterns, different phenomenal patterns arise including decomposition, dissolution, and integration into ecosystem.

The formalization's Nonduality theorem establishing all phenomena are inseparable from substrate means dying organism is presentation of substrate throughout process of dying and death. The transformation from living-presentation to dead-presentation to decomposed-presentation involves changes in phenomenal patterns but not separation from substrate. If substrate is consciousness-itself in idealist interpretation, then even in death organism-presentation remains within consciousness. If substrate is neutral, organism-presentation transforms but substrate continues presenting.

For understanding fear of death and death anxiety, the formalization suggests these often involve reifying organism-presentation as essential unchanging self that death will annihilate. If one identifies with organism-presentation as essential me-substance, death appears as absolute termination threatening everything. But emptiness axiom establishes phenomena lack essential unchanging nature, there is no essential self-substance to be annihilated. Death is transformation of phenomenal patterns, grievous loss of particular presentation-form but not annihilation of substrate.

The formalization's framework doesn't provide traditional consolations about personal survival or afterlife, because personal-identity as currently presented depends on specific bodily and psychological conditions that death terminates. But it suggests that ultimate ground, substrate Ω, is not threatened by death of particular phenomenal presentations. What one ultimately is, if identified with substrate rather than with phenomenal self-presentation, is not destroyed by death. This provides different kind of comfort based on ontological insight rather than survival-beliefs.

For medical ethics and end-of-life care, the formalization suggests focusing on quality of dying-presentations rather than extending life at all costs. If organisms lack essential nature requiring preservation and death is transformation rather than annihilation, then allowing death when life-presentations involve overwhelming suffering may be compassionate response. The formalization supports palliative care prioritizing comfort and dignity in dying-process over prolonging life-presentation regardless of suffering.

The formalization's dependent arising framework establishes that dying-presentations arise from conditions including disease-process, medical interventions, social support, spiritual preparation, and personal choices. How one dies depends on these conditions, which means dying can be approached with intentionality and supported through creating appropriate conditions. This grounds hospice philosophy emphasizing good death through comprehensive support for dying-process.

For grief and bereavement, the formalization suggests mourning is response to loss of particular phenomenal presentation (deceased person's presence in one's experience) while recognizing that person was never absolutely separate from oneself or from substrate. The grief is real emotional presentation arising from loss, but metaphysical sting may be reduced by understanding that deceased was phenomenal presentation of substrate now transformed rather than essential separate substance now annihilated. The connection at substrate-level was never severed though phenomenal form is lost.

## Evolution

The formalization's framework provides ontological context for understanding evolution without requiring teleology or essential natures. Evolutionary processes are phenomenal-level patterns of transformation in populations over time, arising from conditions including variation, selection, inheritance, and drift. Evolution doesn't reveal essential natures species were destined to become, it describes historical phenomenal patterns arising from conditions.

The formalization's emptiness axiom establishes organisms lack essential unchanging species-nature, species are phenomenal classification-conventions applied to organisms showing family resemblance rather than essential properties all members share. Species boundaries are fuzzy and arbitrary to degree because they're conventional categorizations of continuous variation rather than essential kinds. This accords with biological recognition that species concepts are pragmatic tools rather than discovery of natural essences.

The formalization's dependent arising framework explains how evolution occurs through phenomenal-level processes without requiring mysterious guiding forces or essential destinations. Organism-presentations arise from genetic and environmental conditions, genetic-variation-presentations arise from mutation and recombination, selection-presentations arise from differential reproduction, population-pattern-presentations transform over generations as these processes continue. Evolution is phenomenal-level causal pattern, not progress toward essential perfection.

For understanding evolutionary adaptation, the formalization suggests adaptations are phenomenal patterns that happened to arise and persist under particular selective conditions rather than optimal solutions realizing essential adaptive design. Many adaptations are contingent historical accidents that work well enough rather than perfect realizations of engineering ideals. Organisms are phenomenal presentations arising from historical causal processes, not designed entities expressing essential functional natures.

The formalization's Nonduality theorem establishing all phenomena are inseparable from substrate means all evolved organisms are presentations of same substrate. The diversity of life-presentations reflects different ways substrate presents itself through evolutionary processes, all interconnected through common ancestry and shared ontological ground. This provides framework for understanding why all life shares biochemical machinery and genetic code, all are presentations of substrate using similar phenomenal patterns.

For understanding convergent evolution where similar traits evolve independently, the formalization suggests this reflects similar phenomenal patterns arising under similar conditions rather than essential design-solutions that must necessarily appear. Flight evolved multiple times not because there's essential flight-nature but because particular conditions favor particular wing-pattern-presentations. The convergence shows phenomenal patterns that work under given conditions, not essential perfection.

The formalization's framework challenges both strict genetic determinism and extreme developmental plasticity views. Organisms arise dependently from both genetic and environmental conditions, genes don't determine organism-essence but provide conditional influences on how organism-presentations arise. Developmental flexibility reflects that presentations arise from multiple conditions rather than from genetic essence alone, but organisms aren't infinitely plastic because phenomenal patterns depend on conditioning factors including genetic constraints.

For synthetic biology and directed evolution, the formalization suggests these work by intentionally structuring conditions from which desired organism-presentations arise rather than discovering or manipulating essential organism-natures. Creating new organisms or evolving new traits involves arranging genetic and environmental conditions to produce targeted phenomenal patterns. The practices demonstrate that organism-presentations are phenomenal patterns arising from conditions rather than expressions of essential natures.

## Ecosystems

The formalization's framework reconceives ecosystems as coordinated phenomenal presentation-patterns rather than collections of separate organism-substances interacting externally. The Nonduality theorem establishes all phenomena are inseparable from substrate, meaning all organisms in ecosystem are presentations of same substrate. The apparent separateness between organisms is phenomenal distinction, their ecological relationships reflect coordinated patterns within unified presenting.

The formalization's dependent arising framework establishes organisms arise from ecosystem-conditions including nutrient cycling, energy flow, climate patterns, and biotic interactions. An organism cannot exist independently of its ecosystem because it arises from ecosystem-conditions continuously. The organism-presentation and ecosystem-presentation are mutually arising patterns, organism is not separate entity inhabiting ecosystem but rather phenomenal pattern inseparable from ecosystem-context.

For understanding ecological relationships including predation, competition, mutualism, and parasitism, the formalization suggests these are coordinated phenomenal patterns rather than interactions between separate substantial entities. Predator and prey are both presentations of substrate arising in causal relation where predator-organism-patterns are maintained through prey-consumption-patterns. The relationship is phenomenal-level coordination rather than interaction between separate substances, both participants are presentations in unified ecosystem-presenting.

The formalization's framework supports holistic ecology viewing ecosystems as integrated wholes rather than mere collections of parts. If organisms are phenomenal presentations inseparable from ecosystem-context and ultimately from substrate, then ecosystem is more ontologically fundamental than isolated organisms. Ecosystem-pattern is unified phenomenal presentation with internal differentiations (organisms), not aggregate of separate organism-substances. This grounds systems ecology and ecosystem-services approaches.

For understanding ecological succession and ecosystem transformation, the formalization's dependent arising framework explains these as phenomenal pattern-changes arising from altered conditions rather than progress toward essential climax-state. Succession represents transformation of phenomenal patterns as organisms modify conditions affecting which presentations subsequently arise. There is no essential destination ecosystem must reach, succession-patterns depend on historical and environmental contingencies.

The formalization's emptiness axiom establishes ecosystems lack essential unchanging nature, ecosystems are phenomenal patterns transforming continuously in response to conditions including species invasions, climate change, and disturbance. No ecosystem has essential pristine-nature requiring restoration to specific historical state. Conservation goals must be based on pragmatic values about which phenomenal patterns to promote rather than on restoring essential nature.

For understanding human impacts on ecosystems and environmental crisis, the formalization provides framework recognizing that humans are phenomenal presentations inseparable from ecosystem-presentations they affect. Environmental degradation is not external humans damaging separate nature-substance but rather transformation of phenomenal patterns from which humans themselves arise. Harming ecosystem is ultimately affecting substrate from which human-presentations arise, the separation enabling environmental destruction is false reification.

## Microbiome

The formalization's framework naturally accommodates understanding of organism-microbiome relationships that challenge traditional organism boundaries. If organism-boundaries are phenomenal conventions rather than absolute ontological separations (as emptiness axiom and Nonduality theorem entail), then whether microbiome is part of organism or separate is conventional decision rather than ontological fact to discover.

The formalization's dependent arising framework establishes that host-organism-presentations arise dependently from microbiome-presentations and vice versa. Gut bacteria affect digestion, immune function, neurological signaling, and behavior, host-organism provides habitat and nutrients for bacteria. These are mutually arising phenomenal patterns, neither exists independently. The conventional distinction between host-self and microbiome-other is pragmatic categorization of intimately interdependent presentations.

For understanding health and disease in holobiont context, the formalization suggests focusing on whole organism-plus-microbiome phenomenal pattern rather than treating host-organism and microbiome as separate entities. Disease-presentations often involve dysbiosis where microbiome-patterns transform in ways producing pathology in host-organism-patterns. Treatment addressing microbiome through probiotics, dietary changes, or fecal transplantation works by transforming conditions from which organism-microbiome phenomenal patterns arise.

The formalization's framework explains why microbiome research has revealed extensive impacts on health previously attributed to host-organism alone. If boundaries are phenomenal conventions, then artificially isolating host-organism-factors from microbiome-factors in research may miss crucial causal patterns. The holistic organism-microbiome presentation is ontologically more fundamental than arbitrary distinctions between host and microbiome.

For understanding immune tolerance of commensal bacteria versus pathogen response, the formalization suggests these reflect different phenomenal patterns in organism-microbiome coordination. The immune-tolerance-pattern arises when conditions enable stable mutualistic organism-microbiome-patterns, immune-attack-pattern arises when conditions signal disruption or invasion. These are phenomenal-level discrimination-patterns rather than essential distinction between self and non-self substances.

## Consciousness

The formalization's framework addresses consciousness in living organisms through same ontological structure applied to all phenomena. If consciousness involves observable phenomenal contents (experiences, qualia, subjective states), then conscious-phenomena are presentations like all phenomena. The formalization's Nonduality theorem establishes conscious-presentations are inseparable from substrate, consciousness is not produced by organism-substance but rather substrate presenting itself through organized phenomenal patterns.

For understanding relationship between biological organization and consciousness, the formalization suggests that as organism-presentation-patterns become more complex, consciousness-presentations become richer and more differentiated. Simple organisms may present minimal consciousness-structure, complex organisms with nervous systems present elaborate consciousness-structure. This is gradient rather than categorical distinction, consistent with evidence for consciousness-like features in organisms across biological complexity spectrum.

The formalization's framework challenges epiphenomenalism treating consciousness as causally inert byproduct of physical processes, because consciousness-presentations and physical-presentations are both phenomenal patterns that causally interact (C1 establishing causation among phenomena). Conscious-experience-presentations causally affect behavior-presentations, pain causes withdrawal, desire causes seeking, attention affects perception. These are phenomenal-level causal relations rather than physical processes with epiphenomenal consciousness-shadows.

For understanding animal consciousness and welfare, the formalization provides framework recognizing that if animals are phenomenal presentations capable of pain, suffering, and experiential states, they warrant moral consideration regardless of cognitive capacities or species-membership. The formalization removes ontological foundation for treating humans as essentially different from animals in ways that would exclude animal-suffering from moral concern. All organisms are presentations of substrate, suffering-presentations matter regardless of which organism-pattern presents them.

The formalization's emptiness axiom establishes that consciousness, like all phenomena, lacks essential unchanging nature. Conscious-experience-presentations arise dependently from conditions including neural activity, sensory input, memory, attention, and environmental context. There is no essential consciousness-substance that organisms possess, consciousness is phenomenal pattern arising when conditions enable it. This explains altered states of consciousness, consciousness changes when conditioning-factors change.

For plant consciousness and debates about whether non-neural organisms can be conscious, the formalization suggests focusing on phenomenal characteristics rather than essential consciousness-properties. If plants exhibit responsiveness, communication, and information-processing patterns, these phenomenal characteristics warrant consideration regardless of whether plants possess essential consciousness-property. The question is what phenomenal patterns organisms present, not whether they have essential consciousness-substance.

## Medical Ethics

The formalization's framework has implications for medical ethics through its reconception of persons, health, disease, and healing. If patients are phenomenal presentations lacking essential unchanging nature (Emptiness axiom), medical ethics cannot be grounded in essential patient-properties but must focus on phenomenal characteristics including suffering-capacity, autonomy-capability, and relational context.

For informed consent and patient autonomy, the formalization supports respecting patients' choices while recognizing that choosing-patients are phenomenal presentations arising from conditions including medical information, cultural values, emotional states, and relationships. Autonomous-choice-presentations arise from conditions, they're not exercises of essential libertarian free will, but they're real phenomenal expressions of patient-presentation-patterns warranting respect. Supporting autonomy means optimizing conditions for informed choosing rather than respecting essential self-determination-property.

The formalization's Nonduality theorem establishing all phenomena are inseparable from substrate suggests physician and patient are ultimately presentations of same substrate, which may inform therapeutic relationship. The relationship is not between absolutely separate autonomous individuals but between phenomenal presentations arising interdependently. This supports relational approaches to medical ethics emphasizing partnership and shared decision-making rather than purely individualist autonomy-models.

For end-of-life ethics and decisions about withholding or withdrawing treatment, the formalization's framework suggesting death is transformation rather than annihilation may influence how these decisions are approached. If death doesn't destroy essential patient-substance and organism-presentations lack essential nature requiring preservation at all costs, then allowing death when life-presentations involve overwhelming suffering may be ethically appropriate. The formalization supports approaches prioritizing patient-defined quality-of-life over mere life-extension.

The formalization's framework challenges allocation decisions based on essential patient-worth or intrinsic value-rankings. If persons are essence-less presentations and ultimate worth derives from substrate presenting through all persons equally, then allocation cannot be based on essential superiority of some patients over others. Allocation requires pragmatic criteria like effectiveness, urgency, and fairness rather than essential worth-judgments. This challenges both explicit and implicit rationing based on disability, age, or social status.

For research ethics and human subjects protection, the formalization's framework supports robust protections while reconceiving their foundation. Protecting research subjects matters not because they possess essential dignity-property but because they present suffering-capacity, autonomy-capability, and vulnerability requiring protection. The phenomenal harms from unethical research are real regardless of whether patients have essential rights-properties, harm-prevention is grounded in effects on phenomenal presentations.

## Pain

Pain in the formalization's framework is phenomenal presentation arising from conditions including tissue damage, neural signaling, attention, emotion, and meaning-attribution. The emptiness axiom establishes pain-presentations lack essential unchanging nature, pain is not essential property that tissue-damage necessarily produces. This explains why pain varies dramatically based on context, attention, expectations, and psychological factors, pain-presentation arises from multiple conditions not solely from physical injury.

The formalization's causality axioms establishing causation operates among phenomena (C1) means pain-phenomena causally affect behavior-phenomena and other-experience-phenomena. Pain causes withdrawal, motivates treatment-seeking, affects mood and cognition, these are phenomenal-level causal effects. Pain's phenomenal reality and causal efficacy don't require pain being essential property or substantial entity, pain is real phenomenal pattern producing real effects.

For chronic pain syndromes where tissue damage doesn't explain pain-intensity or persistence, the formalization's dependent arising framework provides understanding. Chronic-pain-presentations arise from conditions including neural sensitization, psychological factors, social context, and meaning-systems, not solely from ongoing tissue damage. The pain is real phenomenal presentation arising from current conditions regardless of original injury status. Treatment requires addressing multiple conditioning-factors.

The formalization's framework explains placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia through phenomenal-level causal patterns. Expectations and beliefs are phenomenal presentations affecting how pain-presentations arise through causal patterns including attention, emotional response, and possibly neural modulation. The analgesia is real reduction in pain-presentation arising from changed conditions, not fake response to fake treatment. The phenomenal pain-reduction matters regardless of mechanism.

For understanding suffering distinguished from pain, the formalization suggests suffering involves additional phenomenal layers beyond pain-presentation including resistance to pain, identification with pain as essential self-state, fear of pain's permanence, and meaning-attribution. The formalization's emptiness axiom suggests that recognizing pain-presentation's essence-less impermanent nature may reduce suffering without eliminating pain. Pain remains as phenomenal presentation but relationship to it transforms.

## Genetics

The formalization's framework reconceives genetic determinism and genetic essentialism. If organisms lack essential unchanging nature (Emptiness axiom), genes cannot encode organism-essence. Genes are phenomenal information-patterns that influence conditions from which organism-presentations arise, they don't determine essential nature. The formalization's dependent arising framework establishes organism-presentations arise from genetic information plus developmental, environmental, and stochastic conditions.

For understanding gene expression and epigenetics, the formalization's framework naturally accommodates findings that genetic effects depend on context. Gene-expression-patterns arise from conditions including cellular environment, developmental stage, and environmental exposures, not from genes themselves as essential determinants. The same genetic information produces different organism-presentations under different conditions because presentations arise dependently from multiple factors.

The formalization's framework challenges genetic essentialism in medicine and society treating genes as essential nature determining health, behavior, and identity. Genes influence phenomenal patterns but don't constitute essential predetermination. Genetic risk factors are probabilistic influences on presentations-arising rather than essential destinies. This supports recognizing genetic information's value while avoiding genetic determinism that would deny possibility of transformation through changed conditions.

For gene editing and genetic enhancement, the formalization suggests these work by altering conditional influences on presentations-arising rather than changing essential nature. Editing genes affecting disease-risk alters conditions from which disease-presentations arise, it doesn't correct essential genetic-nature or create essential enhancement. The ethical evaluation depends on phenomenal effects, whether changes reduce suffering and enable flourishing, not on whether they violate essential human nature.

The formalization's Nonduality theorem establishing all phenomena are inseparable from substrate means genetic diversity across organisms represents different ways substrate presents itself through evolutionary processes. Genetic commonalities across life reflect shared phenomenal patterns in substrate's presenting, genetic differences represent phenomenal variation. This framework supports both recognizing biological continuity across life and appreciating diversity without reifying genetic differences as essential kinds.

## Limitations

The formalization establishes ontological structure but doesn't determine all biological and medical conclusions. That organisms lack essence and arise dependently from conditions are metaphysical claims constraining but not determining biological theories and medical practices. Additional empirical investigation and pragmatic evaluation are needed to apply ontological framework to specific biological and medical questions.

The formalization doesn't specify which phenomenal characteristics constitute life, health, disease, or death. These require conventional definitions based on observable phenomenal patterns serving pragmatic purposes. The formalization establishes that such definitions are conventions rather than discoveries of essential properties, but it doesn't determine which conventions are optimal. Biological and medical communities must make these conventional determinations.

The relationship between substrate and phenomenal presentations in biological context requires further investigation. If substrate is consciousness-itself, how does this relate to biological organization and neural complexity? If substrate is neutral, how do mental and physical phenomenal aspects relate? The formalization constrains possibilities but doesn't determine substrate's nature or presentation-mechanisms.

For medical practice, the formalization provides ontological framework but doesn't replace clinical judgment about treatment effectiveness, risk-benefit ratios, and patient-specific factors. That treatments work through phenomenal-level causation altering arising-conditions is ontological claim, but which treatments are effective for which conditions requires empirical research. The formalization shapes understanding but doesn't determine medical decisions.

The formalization's implications for consciousness in non-neural organisms, boundaries between living and non-living, and origins of life require empirical investigation informed by ontological framework. The formalization suggests approaches and constraints but doesn't provide specific answers. Biological research must investigate these questions using formalization's ontological insights as guiding framework.

## Conclusion

The machine-verified formalization of non-dual ontology establishes through rigorous proof that phenomena lack intrinsic essence, all phenomena are inseparable presentations of unique substrate, and phenomena arise dependently from other phenomena. Applied to biology and medicine, these formally proven metaphysical claims require reconceptualization of organisms as phenomenal presentation-patterns rather than bounded substantial entities, boundaries as phenomenal conventions rather than ontological absolutes, disease and health as presentation-patterns arising from conditions rather than essential states, treatment as intervention in phenomenal-level causal patterns altering arising-conditions, and death as transformation of phenomenal patterns rather than annihilation of essential organism-substance.

For biology, the formalization provides ontological framework understanding life as organizational pattern in phenomenal presenting rather than essential property, organisms as presentations arising dependently from genetic and environmental conditions, species as phenomenal classification-conventions rather than essential natural kinds, evolution as historical phenomenal pattern-transformation rather than progress toward essential perfection, and ecosystems as coordinated phenomenal presentation-patterns with internal differentiations rather than collections of separate organism-substances.

For medicine, the formalization suggests understanding patients as phenomenal presentations warranting care based on suffering-capacity and autonomy-capability rather than essential properties, disease as transformation of presentation-structure arising from multiple conditions rather than invasion by essential disease-entities, healing as emergence of health-presentations when conditions change rather than restoration of essential healthy nature, pain and suffering as phenomenal patterns influenced by multiple conditioning factors including psychological and social contexts, and death as transformation requiring supportive care rather than enemy requiring defeat at all costs.

The unprecedented contribution of this formalization is rendering precise through machine-verified logic what holistic medicine and systems biology have suggested, that organisms are not isolated substances with essential natures but rather phenomenal patterns arising from and inseparable from larger contexts, that health and disease are not essential states but phenomenal patterns arising from conditions, and that healing requires comprehensive attention to conditioning factors. This isn't speculation but formal mathematics, the claims follow deductively from explicit axioms proven internally consistent.

Whether the formalization's metaphysics corresponds to biological reality remains open for empirical investigation through examining whether organisms exhibit essence-properties under scrutiny, whether organism-boundaries prove absolute or permeable when investigated carefully, whether genetic information determines essential nature or influences conditional arising, and whether treating organisms as phenomenal presentations rather than substantial entities improves medical outcomes. But the formalization establishes that non-dual ontology is logically coherent, can accommodate biological findings, and provides unified framework for understanding life, organisms, health, disease, and healing. For biology and medicine, this is not merely philosophical speculation but formally verified alternative to substance-based frameworks requiring either acceptance or empirical refutation.
