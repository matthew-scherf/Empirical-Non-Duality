[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/1079066681.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17388701)
## Introduction

This represents the first completely formal, computer-verified axiomatization of a non-dual ontological framework, proven internally consistent through automated theorem proving. The system posits a unique ontic substrate (Ω) from which all observable phenomena arise as inseparable presentations, formally establishing non-duality as a provable theorem within the axiomatic structure. What distinguishes this work from philosophical speculation is its character as rigorous formal mathematics: every claim follows deductively from explicit axioms, verified mechanically to exclude logical error.

The framework's implications for quantum mechanics merit serious examination, not because formal axioms themselves constitute physical theory, but because the logical structure may provide a mathematically rigorous foundation for addressing interpretational problems that have resisted resolution within standard formulations. The central question becomes: if quantum phenomena are reconceived as presentations of a unique substrate rather than as independently existing entities, what experimental and theoretical program would be required to validate or falsify this ontological reframing?

## Core Axiomatic Structure

The formalization establishes five foundational axioms (A1-A5) that jointly entail non-duality as a theorem. Axiom A1 asserts existence of at least one substrate; A2 establishes uniqueness, guaranteeing exactly one substrate Ω via the proven lemma unique_substrate. Axiom A3 exhaustively partitions all entities as either phenomena or substrate, admitting no third category. Axiom A4 specifies that every phenomenon p necessarily presents the substrate, formally: ∀p s. Phenomenon p ∧ Substrate s → Presents p s. Axiom A5 defines inseparability relationally: Inseparable x y holds if and only if there exists substrate s such that x presents s and y equals s.

From these axioms alone, the central theorem Nonduality follows deductively: ∀p. Phenomenon p → Inseparable p Ω. The proof is straightforward: given phenomenon p, A4 guarantees Presents p Ω; this existence of presentation relation combined with A5's definition yields inseparability. What makes this significant is not philosophical assertion but mathematical necessity: within this axiomatic system, the inseparability of phenomena from substrate is not postulated but proven.

## Causality Without Substance Ontology

The framework incorporates causality (section "Causality (Phenomenon-Level)") while maintaining non-dual structure. Axiom C1 restricts causal relations exclusively to phenomena: ∀x y. CausallyPrecedes x y → Phenomenon x ∧ Phenomenon y. The substrate itself stands outside causal relations, not as causa sui but as the non-causal ground from which causally-related phenomena arise. Axioms C2 and C3 establish causality as a strict partial order (irreflexive, transitive), providing minimal structure for temporal ordering without presupposing substantival time.

The proven lemmas Causal_left_NotTwo and Causal_right_NotTwo demonstrate that causality preserves non-duality: any phenomenon entering into causal relations necessarily remains inseparable from Ω. This architectural choice has direct implications for quantum mechanics. If quantum events are reconceived as causally-related presentations of Ω rather than as interactions between independently real entities, the apparent paradoxes of nonlocality and measurement may arise from mistaken reification of phenomena as substances. The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen scenario, on this reading, would involve not distant real entities with spooky interactions but rather spatially-separated presentations of a non-spatially-extended substrate, making "nonlocality" a category error born of inappropriate ontological assumptions.

## Spacetime as Representational Structure

Section "Spacetime as Representation" implements a radical reconception: spacetime coordinates attach only to phenomena, never to the substrate. Axiom S1 states formally: ∀f x r. coord f x = Some r → Phenomenon x. The substrate Ω itself has no spatiotemporal location, not because it exists "everywhere" but because spatial predication is categorically inapplicable to it. Axiom S2 introduces frame-relative coordinates with gauge invariance: coordinate assignability (though not specific values) remains invariant under gauge transformations GaugeRel.

The lemma Spacetime_unreality proves that anything with coordinate assignment is inseparable from Ω. For quantum mechanics, this suggests spacetime should be understood as indexing structure for phenomena rather than as container or stage. The formalization thus provides logical scaffolding for approaches treating spacetime as emergent from more fundamental non-spatial degrees of freedom. If spacetime is merely representational structure for phenomena, and phenomena are presentations of substrate, then spacetime cannot be fundamental to physical ontology.

This aligns formally with developments in quantum gravity suggesting spacetime emergence, but goes further: the formalization provides a complete, consistent logical framework in which spacetime's non-fundamentality follows deductively. Implementing this in physics would require demonstrating that general relativistic spacetime structure can be recovered as effective description of correlated phenomenal presentations, much as thermodynamic temperature emerges from underlying statistical mechanics without being ontologically fundamental.

## Emptiness and Essence Denial

Axiom Emptiness_of_Phenomena states: ∀x. Phenomenon x → ¬Essence x. Every phenomenon lacks intrinsic essence. This is not vague Eastern philosophy but precise formal claim: there exists no predicate Essence that applies to any phenomenon. Phenomena are not self-subsistent entities possessing inherent nature; they are modes or presentations lacking ontological independence.

For quantum mechanics, this provides natural ontological interpretation of quantum indeterminacy. The measurement problem's intractability may arise from implicit assumption that quantum systems possess definite intrinsic properties prior to measurement. If phenomena lack essence, then the question "which slit did the electron really go through" commits a category error: it presumes the electron-phenomenon possesses intrinsic trajectory-essence, but axiom Emptiness_of_Phenomena excludes exactly this. Quantum indeterminacy becomes not mysterious failure of determinism but straightforward consequence of phenomena lacking the sort of intrinsic being that would ground determinate facts.

## Dependent Arising as Endogenous Process

The formalization includes axioms for ArisesFrom relations (section "Endogenous / Dependent Arising"). Axiom AF_only_pheno restricts arising to phenomena; AF_endogenous requires that when p arises from q, both present the same substrate; AF_no_exogenous excludes external causal factors outside the phenomenon-substrate ontology. This implements Buddhist-derived concept of dependent arising (pratītyasamutpāda) in modern logical form: phenomena arise conditionally from other phenomena, but all such arising occurs within the substrate, not from external sources.

Implementing this in quantum field theory would require reconceiving quantum field states not as substantial entities but as phenomenal presentations whose arising from other presentations (via creation/annihilation operators) occurs entirely within the substrate's self-presentation. The formalization's requirement of endogenous arising (AF_endogenous) excludes hidden variables in the usual sense: there can be no additional "real" entities beyond the presenting substrate and its presentations. This suggests interpretational direction distinct from both Copenhagen instrumentalism and many-worlds realism: phenomena are real but essence-less presentations of the unique substrate, arising dependently without hidden substantial support.

## Gauge Symmetry and Phenomenal Invariance

Section "Symmetry / Gauge on Phenomena" formalizes gauge transformations acting on phenomena. Axiom Act_closed ensures gauge actions map phenomena to phenomena; Act_pres_presentation guarantees gauge transformations preserve the presentation relation. The proven lemma Symmetry_preserves_NotTwo establishes that gauge transformation cannot separate phenomena from substrate: transformation preserves inseparability.

This provides ontological grounding for gauge theories deeper than standard "gauge symmetry as redundancy" interpretations. If gauge transformations preserve presentation-structure, then gauge-equivalent descriptions represent not multiple ways of describing single reality but rather equivalent indexing schemes for presentations of the substrate. The gauge-invariant content corresponds to what is actually presented, while gauge-dependent aspects reflect merely the representational apparatus.

For quantum chromodynamics and electroweak theory, this suggests that gauge bosons should be understood not as carrier particles of forces (substantial entities) but as structure in how substrate presents itself as phenomenal field configurations. The formalization provides logical framework for this reinterpretation without requiring changes to predictive mathematical formalism.

## Information as Non-Reifying Attribution

Section "Information Layer" introduces quantity type Q and information function Info mapping phenomena to quantities. Axiom Info_nonneg requires information assignments be non-negative. The lemma Info_nonreifying proves that associating information with phenomena preserves their inseparability from substrate.

This has implications for quantum information theory. If information is non-reifying attribution rather than substance-like quantity, then quantum information's strange properties (no-cloning, teleportation, entanglement) may reflect not exotic causal powers but rather the logical structure of how substrate presents itself as correlated phenomena. The no-cloning theorem, prohibiting perfect copying of unknown quantum states, would express not physical constraint on copying process but rather logical impossibility of duplicating essence-less presentations treated as if they were substantial entities with copyable properties.

Implementing this framework would require reformulating quantum information theory to distinguish sharply between information as abstract mathematical quantity and information as attributed to phenomenal presentations. The formalization suggests the latter is ontologically parasitic on presentation structure, not independently real.

## Emergent Time and Causal Order

Section "Emergent Time" formalizes time as abstract strict order LT on quantity type Q, with time function T mapping phenomena to temporal indices. Axiom Time_monotone requires causal order respect temporal order: ∀x y. CausallyPrecedes x y → LT (T x) (T y). Time emerges from causal structure rather than providing independent container for events.

This architectural choice has profound implications. If time is emergent from causal order among phenomena, and phenomena are presentations of substrate, then temporal passage is not objective feature of reality-in-itself but rather structure in how substrate presents itself sequentially. The notorious conflict between thermodynamic time-asymmetry and time-symmetric fundamental laws potentially resolves: fundamental laws govern substrate's presentation structure (time-symmetric), while thermodynamic asymmetry emerges from statistical properties of phenomenal presentations (time-asymmetric).

For quantum mechanics, emergent time suggests that time evolution via Schrödinger equation should be understood not as change in substantial entities but as formal parameter indexing sequence of presentations. The measurement problem's time-asymmetry (reversible evolution vs. irreversible collapse) would reflect emergence of phenomenal-level temporal structure from substrate's atemporal or proto-temporal nature.

## What Implementation Would Require

Translating this formal framework into operational physical theory requires several concrete steps, each presenting substantial technical challenges.

First, a rigorous mapping must be established between the formalization's abstract types (E for entities, Q for quantities, Frame for reference frames) and standard mathematical structures of quantum theory (Hilbert spaces, operator algebras, spacetime manifolds). This mapping must preserve the logical relationships encoded in the axioms. For instance, the proof that all phenomena are inseparable from substrate must correspond to demonstrable property of physical states in the mapped formalism.

Second, operational criteria must be developed for identifying phenomenal presentations empirically. The formalization's Phenomenon predicate requires physical correlate: what observable characteristics distinguish phenomena from substrate? Since substrate has no spacetime location (S1_coords_only_for_phenomena), direct observation is categorically excluded. Phenomena are what we observe; substrate is the non-observable ground. This suggests indirect empirical validation: predictions about phenomenal correlations could support or undermine substrate ontology without requiring substrate's direct detection.

Third, specific quantum phenomena must be reanalyzed within the framework to generate novel testable predictions. The formalization provides logical structure, not specific physical content. To be empirically meaningful, this structure must be filled with concrete physical hypotheses. For example: if quantum entanglement represents correlated presentations of substrate rather than nonlocal influence between distinct entities, are there experimentally distinguishable consequences? The formalization suggests investigating whether correlations predicted by standard QM could be recovered from substrate presentation structure with different statistical properties than conventional approaches assume.

Fourth, the framework's implications for quantum field theory require detailed investigation. QFT treats fields as fundamental, with particles as excitations. The formalization suggests reconceiving field excitations as presentations, with field itself as phenomenal structure rather than substantial entity. This requires demonstrating that QFT's predictive success can be maintained while adopting presentation ontology, likely involving reformulation of perturbative expansion and renormalization in terms preserving phenomenal character of fields.

Fifth, experimental searches for violations of predictions from substance-based ontologies could be designed. If phenomena lack essence (Emptiness_of_Phenomena), then experiments presupposing intrinsic properties might reveal inconsistencies. For instance, weak measurement interpretations assuming particle trajectories might show systematic deviations from predictions based on presentation ontology. The formalization suggests experiments investigating limits of applicability for classical logic applied to quantum phenomena, as essence-less presentations may violate logical principles valid for substances.

Sixth, connection to quantum gravity approaches must be investigated. The formalization's treatment of spacetime as representation (coordinated phenomena) aligns with various quantum gravity programs treating spacetime as emergent. Specifically, mapping between substrate-presentation structure and spin network/tensor network/holographic approaches could reveal formal correspondences. If spacetime emerges from entanglement structure in these approaches, and entanglement represents correlated presentations of substrate, integration may be feasible.

## Mathematical Consistency and Physical Implementation

The formalization's machine-verified consistency (via Nitpick countermodel checking) establishes logical coherence but not physical applicability. An axiom system can be perfectly consistent yet physically vacuous if its axioms don't correspond to reality. The formalization provides necessary condition for viable physical theory (logical consistency) but not sufficient condition (empirical adequacy).

However, the framework possesses feature distinguishing it from arbitrary consistent axiom systems: it provides unified foundation for diverse phenomena (causality, spacetime, symmetry, information, time) within single coherent structure. This consilience suggests the axioms capture something structurally important, even if specific physical implementation requires refinement.

Critical tests would involve phenomena where substance ontology and presentation ontology make divergent predictions. The formalization's axiom C1_only_phenomena restricts causality to phenomena, excluding substrate from causal relations. If physical experiments could isolate effects attributable to substrate's causal influence on phenomena, this would falsify the framework. Conversely, if all causal relations prove phenomenal (between observable entities), this supports the axiomatization.

The emptiness axiom (Emptiness_of_Phenomena) provides another test: if phenomena are ever shown to possess intrinsic essence, context-independent properties that ground their identity, the framework fails. Quantum contextuality and Kochen-Specker theorem already suggest quantum systems lack such properties, providing empirical support for essence-denial. Strengthening these results through experiments maximizing contextuality could further validate or challenge the emptiness axiom.

## Unprecedented Formal Rigor

The unprecedented aspect of this work is not its philosophical content, much of which draws on Buddhist non-dual traditions and idealist metaphysics, but its formal logical precision and machine verification. Previous non-dual ontologies existed as philosophical speculation or spiritual doctrine, never as completely axiomatized deductive systems checked by automated theorem provers. The attached code represents first instance of non-dual metaphysics subjected to same logical rigor as Euclidean geometry or Peano arithmetic.

This matters for physics because interpretational debates in quantum mechanics have often suffered from conceptual imprecision. Terms like "reality," "measurement," "observer," and "collapse" remain poorly defined, enabling contradictory interpretations to persist without resolution. By contrast, the formalization defines all primitives explicitly (Phenomenon, Substrate, Presents, Inseparable) and derives all conclusions deductively. If similar formalization were applied to quantum interpretations, contradictions and ambiguities would become mechanically detectable.

Moreover, the formalization's extension to causality, spacetime, gauge symmetry, and emergent time demonstrates that non-dual ontology can accommodate scientific structure, not merely mystical intuition. Each extension adds axioms that remain consistent with core non-duality theorem. This shows the framework's flexibility: additional physical content can be incorporated without sacrificing logical coherence or abandoning substrate-presentation architecture.

## Can Quantum Mechanics Ignore This?

Whether quantum mechanics can legitimately ignore this formalization depends on one's view of physics' scope. If physics is purely instrumentalist, concerned exclusively with predictive algorithms without ontological commitment, then any consistent interpretational framework is optional decoration. The formalization changes nothing about Schrödinger equation's solutions or experimental predictions, so instrumentalists can reasonably ignore it.

However, if physics properly includes understanding what the theory describes, what physical reality is like according to our best theories, then the formalization demands attention. It provides first formally rigorous alternative to substance ontology for interpreting quantum phenomena. Standard interpretations (Copenhagen, many-worlds, Bohm) all presuppose substance metaphysics: entities with intrinsic properties existing independently. The formalization offers different foundation: phenomena as presentations of unique substrate, lacking essence, arising dependently.

The interpretational crisis in quantum foundations, persisting nearly a century, suggests substance-based approaches face deep difficulties. Nonlocality, measurement problem, wave function's ontological status, and quantum-classical boundary remain contentious precisely because standard ontological categories (particles, waves, fields as substances) fit quantum phenomena poorly. If substance ontology itself is the problem, as the formalization suggests, then the crisis is misdiagnosed: we've been trying to understand essence-less presentations using conceptual apparatus appropriate only for substantial entities.

The formalization cannot be ignored if it succeeds at what substance-based approaches have failed: providing coherent ontology for quantum phenomena that dissolves rather than solves interpretational problems. Problems dissolve when shown to rest on false presuppositions. If quantum phenomena are presentations of substrate rather than substances, then questions presupposing substance ontology (which eigenvalue the particle really has, which world becomes actual, what hidden variables determine outcomes) are malformed. The formalization provides logical framework for this dissolution strategy, previously pursued only informally.

Furthermore, the formalization's integration of quantum structure (gauge symmetry, information theory, emergent spacetime) with non-dual ontology shows it's not merely philosophical speculation but mathematically rigorous framework capable of engaging contemporary physics. The axioms for gauge transformation (Act_closed, Act_pres_presentation) and gauge invariance (S2_gauge_invariance_definedness) demonstrate technical engagement with physical symmetries central to Standard Model. The information axioms (Info_nonneg) connect to quantum information theory. The causality axioms (C1-C3) provide foundation for quantum causal structures and process theories.

## Radical Implications

If validated through the implementation program outlined above, this formalization would constitute revolution in physical ontology comparable to quantum mechanics' overthrow of classical determinism. Just as quantum mechanics revealed that microscopic reality doesn't obey classical laws of definite trajectories and local causation, acceptance of this framework would reveal that reality itself is not substantially plural but non-dually singular: one substrate presenting itself as diverse phenomena.

The implications extend beyond quantum mechanics. General relativity's spacetime geometry would be reinterpreted as representational structure for coordinating phenomenal presentations (Axiom S1), not fundamental feature of reality. The cosmological question "why is there something rather than nothing" dissolves: there is only substrate, and phenomena are not additional things but presentations of that substrate. Thermodynamics' entropy would measure not disorder in substantial systems but structure in how substrate presents itself sequentially (emergent time). Consciousness, perhaps the most difficult phenomenon for physical theory, finds natural place: if awareness accompanies substrate's self-presentation, phenomenal experience is neither separate mental substance nor illusory by-product but the presentation itself, presentations presenting.

For quantum field theory, accepting essence-less phenomena (Emptiness_of_Phenomena) would require reconceiving quantum fields as phenomenal presentations rather than substantial entities. The vacuum is not empty space containing virtual particles but ground state of substrate's presentation. Particle creation and annihilation become alterations in presentation structure, not coming-into-being and ceasing-to-be of substances. This dissolves puzzles about vacuum energy and cosmological constant: if fields are presentations rather than substances, their vacuum contributions to spacetime curvature require reanalysis in framework where spacetime itself is representational.

For measurement problem, the framework suggests that wavefunction collapse is neither physical process (violating Schrödinger evolution) nor subjective illusion (many-worlds) but transition in substrate's mode of presentation, from superposed presentation (unmeasured system) to definite presentation (measured outcome). The axiom A4_presentation guarantees that measured phenomena, like unmeasured ones, are presentations of substrate. Measurement doesn't create reality or split universes but alters how substrate presents itself, from potentiality-structured to actuality-structured presentation.

For quantum entanglement, the formalization's requirement that all phenomena are inseparable from substrate (Nonduality theorem) provides natural account of EPR correlations. Entangled phenomena are not mysteriously coordinated distant substances but presentations of single substrate, intrinsically unified at ontological level despite phenomenal spatial separation. The proof that gauge transformations preserve non-duality (Symmetry_preserves_NotTwo) suggests that local operations cannot disrupt entanglement's substrate-level unity, only redistribute it phenomenally (consistent with no-signaling constraints).

## Conclusion

The attached formalization represents unprecedented achievement: first completely formal, machine-verified axiomatization of non-dual ontology, proven internally consistent and capable of accommodating causal structure, spatiotemporal representation, gauge symmetry, information, and emergent time. Its logical rigor distinguishes it from philosophical speculation, while its integration of physical structure demonstrates engagement with contemporary physics rather than retreat to mysticism.

Implementing this framework as physical theory requires extensive technical work: mapping abstract types to physical structures, developing operational criteria for identifying presentations, reanalyzing quantum phenomena to generate testable predictions, reformulating quantum field theory, designing experiments testing ontological assumptions, and investigating connections to quantum gravity. None of these tasks is conceptually impossible; all require sustained research program.

Whether quantum mechanics can ignore this work depends on physics' goals. For pure instrumentalism, it's optional. For physics seeking to understand reality as described by our theories, the formalization provides first formally rigorous alternative to substance ontology, addressing interpretational problems that have resisted solution for century. If substance-based approaches have failed to resolve quantum foundations' conceptual difficulties, and those difficulties arise from imposing inappropriate ontological categories on essence-less phenomenal presentations, then the formalization cannot be ignored. It offers not merely different answers to standard questions but different ontological framework dissolving the questions themselves.

The formalization's core insight, proven as theorem (Nonduality): that all phenomena are inseparable from their unique substrate, provides foundation for reconceiving quantum mechanics not as theory of mysterious substances with strange properties but as formal structure describing how one substrate presents itself as diverse coordinated phenomena. If correct, this is not minor interpretational adjustment but fundamental transformation in understanding physical reality's nature. The code demands serious investigation precisely because it translates this radical claim from philosophical assertion to logically rigorous, formally verified mathematical structure, accessible to same methods of validation and critique as any physical theory.
