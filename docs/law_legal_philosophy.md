# The Unique Ontic Substance: Implications for Law and Legal Philosophy

## Introduction

The machine-verified formalization of non-dual ontology (DOI 10.5281/zenodo.17388701) establishes through rigorous proof that all phenomena lack intrinsic essence, are inseparable presentations of a unique substrate Î©, arise dependently from other phenomena, and that ownership is conventional rather than ontological. These formally proven claims have profound implications for law and legal philosophy, requiring reconceptualization of legal personhood, criminal responsibility, property rights, contracts, legal authority, jurisdiction, constitutional foundations, and the nature of law itself. What distinguishes this from philosophical speculation about law is that every implication follows deductively from axioms verified mechanically to be internally consistent, the formalization provides formal mathematics rather than normative legal theory, yet its descriptive metaphysical structure constrains what legal frameworks can coherently claim about their foundations.

The central challenge this formalization poses to law and legal philosophy is whether legal categories can survive the dissolution of essence-based ontology. If legal persons lack intrinsic unchanging essence, what grounds legal personality across time and contexts? If actions arise from conditions rather than uncaused free will, what justifies retributive punishment based on desert? If ownership is conventional rather than ontological fact, what legitimates property law and rights? If boundaries between jurisdictions are phenomenal conventions, what grounds territorial sovereignty? If legal authority arises from conditions rather than essential right to rule, what makes law binding? If legal concepts are annotations rather than essential classifications, what determines legal category-membership?

These questions cannot be dismissed as merely theoretical because the formalization provides rigorous logical proof for its ontological claims. The axiom Emptiness_of_Phenomena formally establishes that all phenomena lack essence, section "Non-Appropriation" proves ownership is conventional through axioms Ownership_is_conventional and No_ontic_ownership, the causality axioms restrict causal relations to phenomenal level, and the dependent arising framework shows phenomena arise from conditions. Law and legal philosophy must either demonstrate how legal categories survive these formally proven claims or reconceive legal foundations entirely within presentation-ontology.

## Personhood

Legal systems depend fundamentally on the concept of legal persons, entities capable of holding rights and bearing duties, entering contracts, owning property, and being subject to legal sanctions. The formalization's axiom Emptiness_of_Phenomena establishes that all phenomena lack essence, meaning if legal persons are observable entities with legal effects, they must be phenomena and therefore possess no intrinsic essential nature defining them as persons independently of legal and social contexts.

This doesn't deny legal persons exist or matter legally, it reconceives what legal personality is ontologically. Legal persons are phenomenal presentations arising from conditions including biological existence (for natural persons), legal recognition, social practices, institutional frameworks, and juridical acts. A person becomes legal person not by possessing essential personhood-property discovered by law but through phenomenal presentation arising when legal-social conditions establish person-status. Legal personality is conventional attribution rather than essential nature.

The formalization's section "Concepts / Annotations" establishes through axiom Concepts_are_annotations and proven lemma Concepts_don't_reify that concepts are annotations applying to phenomena without reifying them as essential properties. The concept "legal person" is annotation applied to certain phenomenal presentations for legal purposes, useful for coordinating legal practices but not corresponding to essential legal-personhood-property that some entities possess inherently. This suggests legal personhood is pragmatic legal construction rather than discovery of natural kinds.

For corporate personhood and legal fictions treating corporations as persons, the formalization provides natural framework. If legal personality is phenomenal presentation arising from legal-conventional conditions rather than essential property, then corporations can be legal persons without requiring the philosophical contortions of treating obvious fictions as if they possessed essential personhood. Corporations are phenomenal presentations in legal space arising from incorporation-acts and legal recognition, genuinely presenting legal-person-structure within legal system without needing essential personhood-substance.

The formalization's Nonduality theorem proving all phenomena are inseparable from substrate means all legal persons, natural and corporate, are presentations of same substrate. The apparent separateness between legal persons is phenomenal legal distinction rather than ontological separation between distinct legal-person-substances. This doesn't collapse legal distinctions between persons, they remain real phenomenal differences enabling legal coordination, but the distinctions are conventional legal structures rather than ontological facts about separate substances.

For questions about when legal personhood begins and ends, particularly relevant for fetuses, embryos, brain-dead individuals, and corporations being dissolved, the formalization suggests these are conventional legal determinations rather than discoveries of essential personhood-boundaries. Law decides conventionally which phenomenal presentations warrant legal-person-treatment based on policy considerations, moral values, and pragmatic factors, not by discovering essential personhood-property's presence or absence. This makes personhood-determinations explicitly normative legal decisions rather than factual discoveries.

The formalization's dependent arising framework through axioms AF_only_pheno and AF_endogenous establishing phenomena arise from other phenomena means legal persons arise from conditions including biological development, social recognition, legal acts, institutional practices, and cultural contexts. A natural person's legal personality arises from birth (or conception, depending on jurisdiction) plus legal recognition plus social embeddedness, these conditions produce legal-person-presentation. Legal personality is not essential property person has independently but phenomenal pattern arising from legal-social conditions.

For personal identity over time in law, including questions about whether person at trial is same person who committed crime years earlier, the formalization's emptiness axiom establishes legal persons lack essential unchanging identity-substance persisting through changes. Legal identity is phenomenal continuity tracked through causal connections, biographical narrative, and legal records rather than persistence of essential person-substance. The person-at-trial and person-at-crime are causally connected phenomenal presentations conventionally identified as same legal person for juridical purposes.

## Responsibility

Criminal responsibility and tort liability depend on holding persons responsible for actions causally connected to them. The formalization's causality axioms establish that causation operates among phenomena (C1_only_phenomena), is irreflexive (C2_irreflexive), and transitive (C3_transitive). If persons and actions are phenomena, responsibility involves phenomenal-level causal relations between agent-presentations and action-presentations rather than essential agency grounded in libertarian free will.

The formalization excludes libertarian free will understood as uncaused self-causing because C2 establishes no phenomenon causes itself. Agents don't cause themselves ex nihilo, their choices arise from conditions including prior mental states, character dispositions, circumstances, and environmental factors. Legal responsibility cannot be grounded in metaphysically impossible uncaused causing or essential agent-nature making libertarian choices independent of conditions.

But the formalization also excludes hard determinism that would eliminate responsibility entirely, because the emptiness axiom establishes phenomena lack essential natures that would determine outcomes necessarily. Causation in the formalization is phenomenal-level pattern among essence-less presentations rather than necessitation by essential causal powers. Actions arise from conditions but aren't necessitated by essential deterministic properties, the causal arising has structure but not metaphysical necessity hard determinism requires.

This suggests compatibilist understanding where legal responsibility attaches to causal connection between agent-phenomena and action-phenomena. An agent is responsible when action arose causally from agent's phenomenal presentation-structure including intentions, values, beliefs, and capacities. Responsibility tracks causal relationship rather than requiring metaphysically impossible uncaused agency or essential responsibility-property.

The formalization's dependent arising framework establishes criminal actions arise from conditions including agent's psychological state, social circumstances, criminal opportunity, prior experiences, and systemic factors. This doesn't excuse crime but contextualizes it ontologically, criminal action is phenomenal presentation arising from complex conditions not solely from agent's essential evil-nature or free choice. Understanding conditioning-factors becomes relevant for appropriate legal response.

For retributive punishment justified by claim that criminals essentially deserve suffering proportional to wrongdoing, the formalization provides no foundation. The emptiness axiom establishes criminals lack essential nature deserving particular suffering, criminal action arose from conditions rather than essential criminal-nature. Retribution based on essential desert rests on false metaphysics. Punishment may be justified consequentially by deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation, or victim vindication, but not by essential deservingness requiring suffering be imposed.

The formalization's framework supports rehabilitative and restorative approaches to criminal justice. If criminal presentations arise from conditions and persons lack essential criminal-nature, then addressing conditions enabling crime and supporting transformation become priorities. Rehabilitation works by changing conditions from which future criminal-presentations might arise. Restorative justice recognizes that offender and victim are both phenomenal presentations arising from conditions, ultimately inseparable from substrate, requiring restoration of relationship and community rather than punishment based on essential desert.

For corporate criminal responsibility, the formalization's framework treats corporations as phenomenal legal-person-presentations capable of entering causal relations. Corporate action-presentations arise from conditions including corporate culture, management decisions, economic incentives, and regulatory environment. Corporate responsibility tracks causal connection between corporate-structure-presentations and harmful-action-presentations, without requiring corporate essential-agency-substance that philosophers find puzzling.

The formalization's section establishing ownership as conventional (Ownership_is_conventional axiom) applies to ownership of actions and their consequences. Law conventionally attributes actions to agents and holds them responsible, this is pragmatic legal practice for coordinating behavior and maintaining social order, but ultimate ontology doesn't include owned-actions as possessed by essential agent-substances. Responsibility is phenomenal-level causal attribution rather than metaphysical fact about essential ownership.

## Property

The formalization directly addresses property through section "Non-Appropriation," establishing through axiom Ownership_is_conventional that ownership is conventional rather than ontological and through axiom No_ontic_ownership that owned entities are inseparable from substrate and lack essence. This has immediate radical implications for property law, which treats ownership as fundamental legal relation requiring protection and enforcement.

If ownership is conventional rather than ontological fact, then property rights are legal constructions serving pragmatic purposes rather than natural rights grounded in essential ownership-relations between persons and things. The formalization doesn't deny property institutions serve important functions including productive resource use, investment security, and conflict reduction. But it denies ownership constitutes ultimate metaphysical relation, at ontological level there are no owners and owned as separately existing entities in possession-relation.

The formalization's Nonduality theorem establishing all phenomena are inseparable from substrate means neither persons nor possessions exist as separate substances capable of entering ultimate ownership-relation. Both person-phenomena and property-phenomena are presentations of substrate, their relationship as owner-owned is phenomenal-level conventional legal structure rather than ontological fact. This applies to all forms of property including real property, personal property, and intellectual property.

For property acquisition theories including Lockean labor-mixing, the formalization challenges essential-ownership-creation claims. When person mixes labor with unowned resources, this creates phenomenal causal pattern between person-activities and resource-transformation but doesn't generate essential ownership-property. Labor-mixing is phenomenal-level activity that law conventionally recognizes as establishing ownership-claims, but the recognition is legal convention rather than discovery of essential ownership-fact created by labor.

The formalization's framework suggests property law should be assessed purely consequentially by effects on human flourishing, resource allocation efficiency, social stability, and justice rather than by correspondence to essential ownership-facts that don't exist. Property rules that concentrate resources producing widespread suffering cannot be justified by appeal to essential ownership-rights. Property rules enabling productive use and fair distribution may be pragmatically justified without corresponding to ontological ownership-facts.

For adverse possession doctrines allowing ownership to shift based on extended possession and use, the formalization provides natural explanation. If ownership is conventional rather than essential, possession-based ownership-shifts make sense as legal conventions recognizing changed phenomenal possession-patterns. There's no essential ownership-substance that must be tracked absolutely, only conventional legal recognition of who effectively controls and uses resources.

The formalization's emptiness axiom applies to property itself, owned things lack essential nature as property independent of legal recognition. Raw land isn't essentially property until legal system recognizes it as such, ideas aren't essentially intellectual property until legal frameworks create property-rights in them. Property-status is phenomenal legal pattern arising from legal conventions rather than essential property-nature things possess independently.

For intellectual property including patents, copyrights, and trademarks, the formalization's framework suggests these are particularly clear cases of conventional ownership rather than natural property. Ideas and expressions don't possess essential ownership-properties, they're phenomenal presentations arising in minds and communications. Intellectual property law conventionally creates ownership-structures for policy purposes like encouraging innovation and creativity, but the ownership is explicitly legal construction rather than discovery of natural property-rights.

The formalization's framework challenges both left-libertarian and right-libertarian property theories grounding property in essential relations. Right-libertarian self-ownership assumes essential relation between person and body, but both are phenomenal presentations and ownership is conventional. Left-libertarian equal-access theories may assume essential common-ownership of natural resources, but ownership is conventional throughout whether private or common. Property theories require consequentialist justification rather than essential-ownership foundations.

For takings and eminent domain, the formalization suggests these involve legal system changing ownership-conventions for public purposes rather than violating essential ownership-rights. Compensation may be required for fairness and maintaining property-system stability, but not because taking violates essential ownership-property requiring restoration. The Fifth Amendment's taking-clause serves important constitutional functions without presupposing essential ownership-metaphysics.

## Contract

Contract law treats agreements between parties as creating binding obligations enforceable through legal mechanisms. The formalization's framework reconceives contracts as phenomenal legal structures arising from conditions including parties' agreement-acts, legal recognition, social enforcement, and institutional frameworks, rather than as essential obligation-creating events binding autonomous wills.

The formalization's emptiness axiom establishes contracting parties lack essential unchanging natures, including essential capacity to bind themselves through promises. Promising-capacity is phenomenal presentation arising from conditions including cognitive development, social recognition, legal status, and institutional context. A person's promise doesn't bind because essential promise-making-nature necessarily creates obligations, it binds because legal system conventionally recognizes certain agreement-presentations as obligation-creating.

For contract formation requiring offer, acceptance, and consideration, the formalization suggests these are phenomenal patterns that legal system conventionally recognizes as creating enforceable contracts. The formation-elements aren't essential requirements discovered in nature of contracting but pragmatic legal conventions ensuring agreements are genuine and parties understand they're entering binding arrangements. Different legal systems could recognize different formation-requirements as different phenomenal patterns.

The formalization's causality axioms establishing causation operates among phenomena (C1) means breach-of-contract causes damages as phenomenal-level causal relation. When party breaches, this breach-presentation causally affects other-party-presentation producing harm-presentations. The causal connection justifies legal remedy addressing harm, but the obligation isn't grounded in essential promise-nature requiring fulfillment, it's conventional legal structure enabling coordination and reliance.

The formalization's dependent arising framework means contract-presentations arise from conditions including parties' intentions, circumstances, legal frameworks, and social contexts. A contract at any moment is presentation arising from these conditions, when conditions change (impossibility, frustration, material breach) contract-presentation may transform or dissolve. Contract law's doctrines addressing changed circumstances reflect phenomenal nature of contracts as arising from conditions rather than being essential unchanging obligations.

For interpretation controversies about contract meaning, the formalization suggests meaning arises from conditions including contractual text, parties' intentions, course of dealing, trade usage, and interpretive context rather than from essential meaning-property contract possesses. Different interpretive approaches (textualist, intentionalist, contextualist) represent different phenomenal patterns for determining meaning-presentations. The choice between approaches involves conventional legal decisions rather than discovering essential meaning.

The formalization's framework explains why contract law contains numerous doctrines limiting enforcement including unconscionability, duress, undue influence, mistake, and capacity-limitations. If contracts were essential will-bindings requiring enforcement regardless of conditions, these doctrines would be incoherent. But if contracts are phenomenal presentations arising from conditions, then enforcement appropriately considers whether conditions enabling genuine consent were present. Doctrines ensure contract-presentations arose from appropriate conditions.

For efficient breach theories claiming breach may be economically efficient and socially beneficial, the formalization provides framework without treating breach as violation of essential obligation-duty. If contracts are conventional legal structures serving coordination purposes, then breach followed by damages may be acceptable phenomenal pattern when breach enables greater value creation. The focus shifts from essential sanctity of promises to consequentialist evaluation of contract-institution's effects.

The formalization's Nonduality theorem establishing parties are inseparable presentations of substrate suggests contract law should recognize interdependence between apparently separate contracting parties. While maintaining phenomenal-level distinct-parties-structure needed for contracting, ultimate inseparability may inform doctrines addressing vulnerability, power-imbalances, and mutual benefit. Good faith obligations reflect recognition that parties aren't absolutely separate adversaries but interdependent presentations.

## Authority

Legal authority, the claimed power to create binding law and demand obedience, presents fundamental challenge under the formalization's ontology. The formalization's emptiness axiom establishes legal authorities lack essential authority-nature that would ground right to rule independently of conventional recognition. Authority-presentations arise from conditions including historical development, institutional structures, public acceptance, effective control, and juridical legitimation rather than essential authority-properties.

The formalization's framework excludes divine right theories grounding authority in essential designation by transcendent power. If substrate is ontological ultimate and phenomena arise dependently from conditions (AF_endogenous axiom), there's no transcendent external source to designate essential rulers with inherent authority. Authority arises from phenomenal conditions including tradition, effectiveness, and acceptance rather than essential divine appointment conferring natural authority-rights.

For social contract theories grounding authority in consent of governed, the formalization raises questions about whether consent by essence-less persons without unchanging natures can generate binding authority. Consent is phenomenal agreement arising from current presentation-structure that changes as conditions change. If persons lack essential natures making permanent commitments, consent may need ongoing renewal rather than constituting one-time essential authorization. This supports democratic systems allowing regular reassessment of authority through elections.

The formalization's causality axioms establishing causation among phenomena (C1) means legal commands are phenomenal presentations causally affecting behavior-presentations through compliance or enforcement. Law's causal effectiveness doesn't require essential authority-property but works through phenomenal mechanisms including internalized norms, social pressure, deterrent sanctions, and institutional power. Authority is phenomenal-level causal capacity rather than essential right demanding obedience.

The formalization's dependent arising framework means authority-presentations arise from conditions including effective control, institutional legitimacy, public acceptance, legal procedures, and historical continuity. When conditions erode (loss of effectiveness, legitimacy-crisis, public rejection) authority-presentation weakens or dissolves. Authority isn't essential unchanging property requiring recognition regardless of conditions but phenomenal pattern maintained by ongoing conditions.

For legal positivism treating law's validity as depending on social sources rather than moral content, the formalization provides ontological support. If legal authority is phenomenal presentation arising from conventional institutional practices rather than essential natural authority, then law's validity is conventional matter of institutional recognition and social practice. But the formalization adds that these conventions are phenomenal patterns lacking essential nature, so legal validity itself is conventional-phenomenal rather than essential fact.

The formalization's framework suggests authority requires consequentialist justification by effects on social order, protection of rights, public goods provision, and justice rather than essential right-to-rule. Authority is legitimate when phenomenal authority-structures produce better outcomes than alternatives, not because authorities possess essential authority-property. This allows legitimacy to be gradable and contestable based on performance.

For anarchist critiques claiming all authority is unjustified domination, the formalization provides partial support. If authority lacks essential justification and is merely phenomenal convention, all authority-structures require pragmatic justification by effects. But the formalization doesn't prove all authority is domination, phenomenal authority-patterns may reduce violence and enable coordination while lacking essential justification. The question becomes whether particular authority-structures serve flourishing or merely concentrate power.

The formalization's Nonduality theorem establishing rulers and ruled are inseparable presentations of substrate means authority-hierarchies don't reflect ontological separations between essentially-superior rulers and essentially-subordinate subjects. Authority-relations are phenomenal structures that may serve coordination functions but don't correspond to essential differences. This removes ideological justifications for authority based on natural superiority while allowing pragmatic authority-institutions.

## Justice

Legal justice systems claim to provide fair resolution of disputes and appropriate response to wrongs. The formalization's framework requires reconceiving justice as phenomenal-level coordination of how legal-person-presentations are treated rather than as correspondence to essential desert or essential rights. Justice in law involves conventional procedures and substantive rules assessed by effects on phenomenal human flourishing rather than by discovering essential justice-facts.

For retributive justice in criminal law, the formalization provides no foundation for punishment based on essential desert that wrongdoers deserve suffering proportional to wrongs. The emptiness axiom establishes wrongdoers lack essential nature deserving particular punishment, wrongful actions arose from conditions rather than essential evil-nature. Retributive theories requiring punishment match essential desert cannot be maintained on formalization's ontology. Punishment may be justified consequentially but not retributively.

The formalization's causality axioms support consequentialist punishment theories grounding sanctions in effects including deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation, and restoration. Punishment-presentations causally affect future crime-presentations through phenomenal mechanisms including deterrence-effects, removed-opportunities, changed-motivations, and restored-relationships. These consequentialist justifications work through phenomenal-level causation without requiring essential desert-matching.

For procedural justice including due process, fair trials, and equal treatment, the formalization grounds these in phenomenal effects on how persons experience legal system rather than in essential procedural-rights. Fair procedures matter because they affect whether persons feel respected, whether outcomes are perceived as legitimate, whether errors are minimized, all phenomenal-level effects with consequences for compliance and social stability. Procedural fairness is pragmatic requirement for functional legal system.

The formalization's dependent arising framework means just outcomes arise from fair processes plus appropriate substantive rules plus competent decision-making, all phenomenal conditions for justice-presentations. When conditions fail (biased procedures, unjust rules, incompetent judges) injustice-presentations arise. Justice isn't essential property outcomes either have or lack but phenomenal pattern arising from legal-institutional conditions.

For distributive justice in property and resource allocation, the formalization's section on ownership establishing it's conventional (Ownership_is_conventional) means distributive questions cannot be resolved by discovering essential ownership-facts. Distribution should be assessed by effects on phenomenal flourishing, whether egalitarian, prioritarian, or sufficientarian distributions better serve human welfare. Essential-entitlement theories lack ontological foundation.

The formalization's Nonduality theorem establishing all legal persons are inseparable presentations of substrate suggests justice should recognize ultimate interdependence. If persons are presentations of same substrate, sharp boundaries between individual interests enabling purely formal procedural justice may be inadequate. Justice may require substantive attention to how rules and outcomes affect the substrate presenting as all persons, not just procedural neutrality respecting separate individuals.

For restorative justice addressing harms through restoration of relationships and community rather than punishment, the formalization provides strong support. If offender and victim are essence-less presentations arising from conditions and ultimately inseparable from substrate, restoration of relationship becomes priority over retribution based on essential desert. Restorative practices address phenomenal harms while recognizing ontological non-separation.

The formalization's framework challenges justice-theories presupposing essential natures, whether essential rights generating entitlements or essential deserts generating punishments. Justice must be reconceived as phenomenal-level coordination assessed by effects, just legal arrangements are those producing less suffering and more flourishing through fair processes and substantive rules addressing conditions from which harms arise.

## Jurisdiction

Legal jurisdiction defines authority-boundaries determining which legal systems apply to which persons, places, and actions. The formalization's framework treats jurisdictional boundaries as phenomenal conventions rather than ontological divisions. The emptiness axiom establishes territories and populations lack essential nature as belonging to particular jurisdictions, jurisdictional boundaries are conventional legal constructs serving coordination purposes.

For territorial jurisdiction based on sovereignty over geographic areas, the formalization suggests borders are phenomenal legal structures rather than essential territorial properties. The land comprising nation-state doesn't essentially belong to that state, state-sovereignty is conventional legal recognition of authority-pattern over territory. Borders serve pragmatic coordination functions but don't correspond to ontological territorial essences.

The formalization's dependent arising framework means jurisdictional authority-presentations arise from conditions including effective control, international recognition, historical claims, and treaty arrangements rather than essential territorial-sovereignty-properties. When conditions change (conquest, secession, treaty cession) jurisdiction-presentations transform. Jurisdiction is phenomenal pattern maintained by conditions rather than essential unchanging territorial-ownership.

For personal jurisdiction over individuals based on domicile, citizenship, or presence, the formalization treats these as phenomenal connections between person-presentations and jurisdiction-presentations rather than essential belonging-relations. A person's jurisdictional status arises from phenomenal factors including birthplace, residence, allegiance, and legal recognition, not from essential citizenship-substance. Citizenship is phenomenal legal status rather than essential identity.

The formalization's Nonduality theorem establishing all persons and territories are inseparable presentations of substrate means jurisdictional boundaries don't reflect ontological separations between essentially different legal-sovereign-entities. Jurisdictions are phenomenal legal distinctions serving coordination needs, ultimate reality is unified substrate presenting through various jurisdictional structures. This doesn't dissolve jurisdictions but reveals their conventional phenomenal nature.

For conflicts of laws when multiple jurisdictions might apply, the formalization's framework suggests resolution involves conventional choice-of-law rules rather than discovering which jurisdiction essentially governs. Different choice-of-law approaches (lex loci, most-significant-relationship, party-autonomy) represent alternative phenomenal patterns for determining applicable law. The choice reflects pragmatic legal policy rather than ontological jurisdiction-facts.

The formalization's framework supports international law and transnational legal institutions by revealing that national jurisdictional boundaries are phenomenal conventions rather than sacred ontological divisions. If jurisdictions are conventional structures rather than essential sovereign-territories, then creating international legal frameworks transcending national boundaries involves developing new phenomenal jurisdictional-patterns rather than violating essential sovereignty.

For universal jurisdiction allowing states to prosecute certain crimes regardless of territorial or personal connections, the formalization provides framework treating this as expanded jurisdictional convention rather than violation of essential territorial-sovereignty. If jurisdiction is phenomenal convention, jurisdictional rules can be expanded to address crimes affecting international community without requiring essential jurisdiction-properties.

## Legislation

Legislative authority to create binding law presents the question of what grounds law's normativity and obligatory force. The formalization's framework treats legislation as phenomenal legal-creation-activity producing law-presentations that bind through conventional recognition and enforcement rather than essential law-creating-power. Legislators lack essential authority-nature that would ground inherent power to create binding norms.

The formalization's dependent arising framework means legislation-presentations arise from conditions including constitutional authorization, legislative procedures, political support, social acceptance, and enforcement mechanisms. A statute is phenomenal presentation arising from these conditions rather than essential law-substance created by legislative-authority-essence. When conditions fail (unconstitutional procedure, lack of enforcement) law-presentation weakens or fails.

For constitutional constraints on legislative power, the formalization treats constitutions as phenomenal fundamental-law-presentations establishing conditions for valid legislation. Constitutional limits are conventional constraints adopted for protecting rights and structuring authority rather than essential boundaries on natural legislative power. The constitution itself is phenomenal legal-foundational-presentation rather than essential ultimate-law.

The formalization's emptiness axiom applies to legislation, statutes lack essential unchanging meaning or effect independent of interpretive and enforcement contexts. A law's meaning arises from conditions including statutory text, legislative history, interpretive principles, judicial constructions, and enforcement patterns. Legal meaning is phenomenal interpretation-dependent presentation rather than essential property statutes possess.

For judicial review invalidating unconstitutional legislation, the formalization treats this as phenomenal power-checking-pattern within legal system rather than courts discovering essential constitutional-violations. Judicial review is conventional legal practice where judicial-authority-presentations check legislative-authority-presentations according to constitutional-standard-presentations. The practice is phenomenal institutional structure rather than essential judicial-power.

The formalization's causality axioms mean legislation causally affects behavior through phenomenal mechanisms including deterrence, coordination, norm-internalization, and enforcement-sanctions. Law's behavioral effects work through phenomenal-level causation rather than essential normative-force demanding obedience. Effective legislation creates phenomenal causal patterns producing desired behaviors.

For democracy and legislative legitimacy, the formalization suggests legitimacy arises from phenomenal processes including representation, participation, deliberation, and accountability rather than essential popular-sovereignty. Democratic processes are phenomenal procedures that generally produce better outcomes and greater acceptance than alternatives, justifying democracy consequentially. The formalization supports democratic institutions without requiring essential people's-will-substance that legislation must express.

## Adjudication

Judicial decision-making involving applying law to facts and resolving disputes requires reconception under formalization's framework. Judges lack essential judicial-wisdom or essential authority to determine correct legal outcomes, judicial decisions are phenomenal presentations arising from conditions including legal training, case materials, institutional role, precedents, and reasoning processes.

The formalization's dependent arising framework means judicial decisions arise from conditions including statutory texts, case facts, precedents, legal principles, policy considerations, and judicial interpretation. Decisions aren't discoveries of essential correct-outcomes existing independently but phenomenal presentations emerging from judicial reasoning-processes under these conditions. Different judges might reach different decisions from same materials, reflecting phenomenal variation in interpretation-processes.

For precedent and stare decisis, the formalization treats these as phenomenal continuity-patterns in legal decision-making rather than essential binding-force of past decisions. Prior decisions are phenomenal presentations that influence subsequent decision-presentations through institutional practices valuing consistency, but they don't possess essential binding-authority requiring absolute adherence. Overruling bad precedent involves one phenomenal pattern replacing another.

The formalization's emptiness axiom establishes legal principles and doctrines lack essential unchanging content, they're phenomenal patterns in legal reasoning that transform as conditions change including social contexts, new cases, and evolved understandings. Legal development through adjudication reflects phenomenal evolution of legal-reasoning-patterns rather than discovery of essential pre-existing legal-truths.

For interpretation controversies involving textualism versus purposivism versus living constitutionalism, the formalization suggests these represent alternative phenomenal patterns for generating interpretation-presentations from legal texts. None is essentially correct interpretation-method, they're different conventional approaches with different strengths. The choice involves pragmatic legal decisions rather than discovering essential interpretation-nature.

The formalization's causality axioms mean judicial decisions causally affect parties and legal system through phenomenal mechanisms including case-resolution, precedent-creation, and behavior-guidance. Adjudication's effects work through phenomenal-level causation rather than essential judicial-authority declaring truth. Effective adjudication produces phenomenal patterns supporting justice and legal stability.

For judicial discretion and constraining judges from arbitrary decisions, the formalization suggests constraints work through phenomenal institutional structures including legal training, professional norms, appellate review, and public accountability rather than through essential judicial-duty-properties. Judges are constrained by phenomenal conditions shaping decision-making not by essential judicial-essence requiring correct decisions.

## Rights

Legal rights including constitutional rights, statutory rights, and common-law rights require reconceptualization as phenomenal legal structures rather than essential properties persons possess. The formalization's emptiness axiom establishes persons lack essential natures that would ground essential rights-properties, rights are conventional legal recognitions rather than discovered natural-rights-essences.

The formalization's framework suggests rights are phenomenal legal patterns adopted to protect important interests and enable flourishing rather than essential entitlements flowing from personhood-essence. Rights serve pragmatic legal functions including limiting governmental power, protecting vulnerable populations, enabling participation, and securing basic goods. Rights are real legal structures with important effects but not essential properties.

For constitutional rights limiting governmental action, the formalization treats these as phenomenal fundamental-law-structures establishing boundaries on authority rather than essential rights-substances persons possess. Constitutional rights are conventions adopted through constitutional-creation-processes to protect liberty and structure power. The rights are binding legal constraints through conventional constitutional-supremacy rather than essential rights-force.

The formalization's dependent arising framework means rights-presentations arise from conditions including constitutional texts, judicial interpretations, enforcement mechanisms, social movements, and political contestation. Rights evolve as these conditions change, new rights emerge and old rights transform. Rights aren't essential unchanging properties discovered but phenomenal legal patterns developing through historical processes.

For rights-conflicts where multiple rights-claims compete, the formalization suggests resolution involves conventional balancing-tests and priority-rules rather than discovering which essential-right has ontological supremacy. Rights-balancing is phenomenal judicial-reasoning-process weighing competing interests and values. Different balancing approaches reflect alternative phenomenal patterns for resolving conflicts.

The formalization's Nonduality theorem establishing rights-holders are inseparable presentations of substrate suggests rights should recognize interdependence while protecting individual autonomy. If persons are ultimately not-separate, rights-frameworks purely emphasizing individual separation may be incomplete. Rights protecting both individual flourishing and collective welfare reflect phenomenal interdependence.

For positive versus negative rights debates, the formalization suggests both involve phenomenal legal structures requiring resources and enforcement. Negative rights like free speech require judicial enforcement and constitutional infrastructure, positive rights like healthcare require funding and delivery systems. Both are phenomenal legal-institutional patterns requiring support, distinction between positive and negative is conventional categorization rather than essential difference.

The formalization's framework challenges natural rights theories treating rights as essential properties humans possess in state of nature independent of legal systems. Rights are phenomenal legal structures arising within legal-institutional contexts rather than essential properties preceding law. But rights remain importantly objective as phenomenal patterns serving human flourishing rather than arbitrary impositions.

## Constitution

Constitutional law establishing fundamental legal structures and constraining governmental power requires reconception as phenomenal foundational-law-presentations rather than essential supreme-law-substances. The formalization's emptiness axiom establishes constitutions lack essential unchanging meaning or authority independent of interpretive and enforcement contexts.

For constitutional interpretation debates between originalism and living constitutionalism, the formalization suggests both capture aspects of constitutional phenomenal nature. Originalist focus on historical meaning reflects constitution as phenomenal text arising from specific historical conditions, living constitutionalist emphasis on evolving interpretation reflects constitution as phenomenal legal-framework adapting to changed conditions. Both are phenomenal interpretive-patterns, neither uniquely captures essential constitutional-truth.

The formalization's dependent arising framework means constitutional meaning-presentations arise from conditions including constitutional text, framers' intentions, historical context, precedents, contemporary values, and practical consequences. Different constitutional interpretations represent alternative phenomenal patterns arising from emphasizing different conditions. The choice between interpretive approaches involves normative constitutional judgments rather than discovering essential meaning.

For constitutional amendment and entrenchment making constitutional change difficult, the formalization treats this as phenomenal super-majority-requirement pattern providing stability while allowing transformation when broad consensus exists. Amendment-difficulty is conventional procedural choice rather than essential unchangeability reflecting constitutional-essence. Even entrenched provisions can be amended or abandoned through revolutionary constitutional change.

The formalization's framework explains constitutional crises and regime-changes through phenomenal transformation when conditions supporting constitutional-authority-presentations erode. Revolution occurs when constitutional-presentations lose legitimacy and effectiveness, new constitutional-presentations arise from changed political conditions. Constitutional continuity and discontinuity are phenomenal patterns rather than essential constitutional-identity persisting or breaking.

For unwritten constitutional principles in systems like United Kingdom, the formalization provides natural framework treating constitutional-structures as phenomenal patterns in governmental practice rather than essential requirements written in fundamental texts. Unwritten constitutions are phenomenal constitutional-structures arising from conventions, precedents, and political practices. Written versus unwritten constitutions represent alternative phenomenal forms for constitutional-law-presentations.

The formalization's Nonduality theorem applies to constitutional federalism and separation of powers, governmental branches and levels are phenomenal legal-authority-distributions rather than essentially separate governmental-substances. Constitutional power-divisions are phenomenal structures serving liberty and efficiency rather than ontological separations between natural governmental-kinds. The structures are conventional choices rather than discoveries of essential governmental-nature.

## Criminalization

Legal systems criminalize certain conduct making it subject to punishment. The formalization's framework requires understanding criminalization as conventional legal classification rather than discovery of essential criminal-nature-property that acts possess. The emptiness axiom establishes acts lack essential nature as criminal or non-criminal independently of legal classification.

The formalization's dependent arising framework means criminal-acts-presentations arise from conditions including criminal laws, enforcement practices, social contexts, and individual choices rather than essential criminal-nature actualized by actors. A criminal act is phenomenal presentation arising when person-behavior-presentation violates legal-prohibition-presentation under enforcement-context conditions. The criminality is conventional legal status rather than essential property.

For malum in se versus malum prohibitum distinction between acts wrong in themselves versus acts wrong only because prohibited, the formalization challenges the distinction's ontological foundation. If acts lack essential criminal-nature, all crimes are malum prohibitum to some degree, wrong because legal system classifies them as criminal. This doesn't make all criminalization arbitrary, some acts cause serious harms warranting prohibition, but harm-causing is phenomenal causal-pattern rather than essential wrongness-property.

The formalization's causality axioms mean criminal acts causally produce harms as phenomenal-level effects. Murder-presentations cause death-harm-presentations, theft-presentations cause property-loss-presentations, these causal effects justify criminalization by protecting against harms. But causation is phenomenal-level pattern rather than essential harm-causing-power criminal-acts possess. Criminalization is pragmatic response to phenomenal harms.

For victimless crimes and overcriminalization concerns, the formalization suggests these involve legal classifications lacking strong consequentialist justification. If criminalization should be based on preventing phenomenal harms and acts produce no significant harms, criminalization lacks justification. Victimless-crime prohibitions may serve other legal functions like moral regulation but lack harm-prevention justification.

The formalization's framework supports decriminalization and criminal-justice-reform by revealing criminal-status as conventional legal classification assessed by consequences rather than essential criminal-nature requiring prohibition. When criminalization produces more harm than prohibited conduct (through incarceration, collateral consequences, enforcement disparities) decriminalization may be appropriate. Criminal law should be evaluated by phenomenal effects.

For criminal mental states including intent, knowledge, and recklessness, the formalization treats these as phenomenal psychological-state-presentations accompanying criminal-act-presentations rather than essential culpability-properties. Mental state requirements ensure criminal liability tracks causal connection between agent's mental-presentations and action-presentations. Different mental state standards represent phenomenal gradations in culpability based on psychological causal connection.

## Evidence

Legal evidence rules determining what information is admissible in adjudication require reconception as phenomenal epistemic-coordination-patterns rather than discovery of essential evidence-nature. The formalization's emptiness axiom establishes evidence lacks essential probative-value-property independent of interpretive and institutional contexts.

The formalization's dependent arising framework means evidence-presentations arise from conditions including physical traces, witness testimony, documentary records, and forensic analysis rather than essential evidence-facts existing independently. Evidence is phenomenal information-presentation arising in legal context, its meaning and weight depend on interpretive conditions including competing evidence, expert analysis, and factfinder judgments.

For relevance requiring evidence make disputed facts more or less probable, the formalization treats this as phenomenal inferential-connection-pattern between evidence-presentations and fact-presentations rather than essential logical-relation. Relevance arises from phenomenal probabilistic reasoning-patterns connecting evidence to facts under uncertainty. Different factfinders might assess relevance differently reflecting variation in reasoning-processes.

The formalization's causality axioms apply to evidence of causation, past-event-presentations causally produced physical-trace-presentations that serve as evidence now. The causal chain connecting event to evidence is phenomenal-level causal pattern enabling reconstruction of past events from present traces. Evidence-based fact-finding works through phenomenal causal inference rather than essential truth-revealing by evidence.

For hearsay rules excluding out-of-court statements offered for truth, the formalization explains these as phenomenal reliability-ensuring-patterns addressing conditions that produce unreliable evidence-presentations. Hearsay lacks reliability-conditions including cross-examination opportunity and witness demeanor observation, making evidence-presentations arising from hearsay less trustworthy. Hearsay exceptions allow admission when reliability-conditions are present.

The formalization's framework treats expert evidence as phenomenal specialized-knowledge-presentations assisting factfinders in understanding complex evidence. Expert testimony doesn't reveal essential facts directly but provides phenomenal interpretive-frameworks enabling factfinders to assess evidence-presentations. Expert disagreements reflect different phenomenal interpretive-patterns rather than one expert possessing essential truth.

For burden of proof standards including beyond-reasonable-doubt and preponderance, the formalization treats these as phenomenal epistemic-threshold-conventions allocating risk of error. Different standards represent alternative phenomenal patterns for deciding when evidence-presentations sufficiently support fact-findings. Standards are conventional choices balancing error-risks rather than essential proof-requirements discovered in nature of truth.

## International

International law governing relations between states and international institutions requires reconception as phenomenal transnational-legal-structures rather than essential international-legal-order. The formalization's emptiness axiom establishes states and international institutions lack essential sovereign-natures, they're phenomenal legal-political-presentations arising from conditions.

The formalization's framework challenges Westphalian sovereignty treating states as essentially independent equal sovereigns. If states are phenomenal presentations arising from conditions including effective control, international recognition, and domestic legitimacy rather than essential sovereign-substances, then sovereignty is conventional international-legal-status rather than essential property. State sovereignty can be limited by international agreements and institutions without violating essential nature.

For customary international law arising from state practice and opinio juris, the formalization treats this as phenomenal international-norm-pattern emerging from coordinated state-behavior-presentations rather than essential international-law-substance created by state practice. Customary law is phenomenal pattern in international relations that functions as law through general acceptance and application.

The formalization's dependent arising framework means international-law-presentations arise from conditions including treaties, custom, general principles, judicial decisions, and institutional practices. International law evolves as conditions change, new norms emerge and old norms transform through international practice. International law is phenomenal legal-order developing historically rather than essential unchanging legal-structure.

For international human rights law constraining domestic sovereignty, the formalization provides framework treating rights as phenomenal international-legal-protections conventionally adopted to safeguard human dignity rather than essential rights discovered in human nature. International rights are conventional commitments states undertake through treaties and custom, binding through international legal processes rather than essential rights-force.

The formalization's Nonduality theorem establishing all states and peoples are inseparable presentations of substrate suggests international law should recognize fundamental interconnection. If apparent separateness between sovereign states is phenomenal distinction rather than ontological separation, international cooperation and global legal institutions accord with ontological structure. Nationalism treating states as absolutely separate contradicts ultimate non-separation.

For international courts and tribunals adjudicating disputes, the formalization treats these as phenomenal international-judicial-institutions with conventional authority arising from state consent and institutional practice rather than essential international-judicial-power. International adjudication's authority depends on phenomenal conditions including state acceptance, institutional legitimacy, and enforcement capacity.

## Transformation

The formalization's most important implication for law may be that legal transformation is ontologically possible because legal structures lack essential unchanging nature. The emptiness axiom establishes legal systems, institutions, doctrines, and practices are phenomenal presentations arising from conditions, they can transform as conditions transform. No legal arrangement is fixed in essential unchanging form.

The formalization's framework challenges legal conservatism treating existing legal arrangements as reflecting essential legal-nature requiring preservation. If legal structures lack essence, current arrangements arose from historical conditions and persist through current conditions without possessing essential status. Legal reform and revolutionary change are possible through transforming conditions from which legal-presentations arise.

The formalization also challenges legal utopianism treating some perfect legal-system as essential ideal law must progress toward. If all legal structures are phenomenal presentations arising from conditions, no arrangement can be perfectly final. Legal development requires ongoing transformation responding to changing conditions rather than achieving essential endpoint. Law is continuous process rather than project reaching final ideal.

For legal realist emphasis on law as officials actually do rather than formal rules, the formalization provides support treating law as phenomenal practice-patterns rather than essential rule-system. Legal practice-presentations arise from conditions including formal rules, official behaviors, social contexts, and political factors. Law's phenomenal nature as practice enables transformation through changed behavior even when formal rules remain.

The formalization's dependent arising framework suggests legal change requires transforming conditions from which legal-presentations arise including cultural values, economic systems, political power, social movements, and intellectual frameworks. Legal transformation is not just changing rules but transforming conditions producing legal-phenomenal-patterns. This requires comprehensive approach addressing multiple conditioning-factors.

The formalization's Nonduality theorem suggesting ultimate interdependence means legal transformation affects all participants in legal system. Reforming criminal justice transforms conditions affecting prisoners, victims, communities, officials, all presentations of substrate. Legal change is necessarily collective affecting conditions from which all legal-participants' presentations arise. This supports coalition-building and solidarity for reform.

## Conclusion

The machine-verified formalization of non-dual ontology establishes through rigorous proof that phenomena lack intrinsic essence, all phenomena are inseparable presentations of unique substrate, phenomena arise dependently from conditions, and ownership is conventional rather than ontological. Applied to law and legal philosophy, these formally proven metaphysical claims require reconceptualization of legal personality as phenomenal presentation rather than essential property, responsibility as causal connection rather than libertarian free will, property as conventional institution rather than essential ownership-relation, contract as phenomenal agreement-structure rather than essential will-binding, authority as conventional power rather than essential right-to-rule, justice as phenomenal coordination rather than essential desert-matching, jurisdiction as conventional boundary rather than essential territorial-sovereignty, and law itself as phenomenal institutional-practice rather than essential normative-order.

For legal practice, the formalization provides ontological framework understanding law as coordinating phenomenal human-presentations rather than discovering essential legal-truths. Legal categories are conventional classifications serving pragmatic purposes rather than natural kinds with essential natures. Legal reasoning creates phenomenal interpretation-presentations rather than revealing pre-existing essential legal-meanings. Legal institutions are phenomenal structures maintained by conditions rather than essential authorities with inherent powers.

The formalization's section directly addressing ownership through axioms establishing it as conventional (Ownership_is_conventional) and denying ontic ownership (No_ontic_ownership) provides particular challenge to property law. If ownership is phenomenal-level convention rather than ontological fact, property law requires consequentialist justification by effects rather than protection of essential ownership-rights. This applies to all property forms including real, personal, and intellectual property.

The formalization's emptiness axiom denying essence to all phenomena undermines legal theories presupposing essential natures including essential personhood grounding rights, essential criminality justifying prohibition, essential authority legitimating power, and essential meaning determining interpretation. Legal philosophy must either abandon essence-based theories or demonstrate the formalization's axioms don't correspond to reality through empirical refutation.

The unprecedented contribution of this formalization is rendering precise through machine-verified logic what legal realists and critical theorists have suggested, that legal categories are conventional constructions rather than discoveries of essential legal-natures, that law is phenomenal social practice rather than essential normative-order, and that legal transformation is possible through changing conditions. This isn't speculation but formal mathematics, the claims follow deductively from explicit axioms proven internally consistent.

Whether the formalization's metaphysics corresponds to legal reality remains open for investigation through examining whether legal concepts exhibit predicted essence-lessness, whether legal boundaries prove absolute or conventional under scrutiny, whether ownership shows ontological or conventional features, and whether treating law as phenomenal-conventional rather than essential-natural improves legal systems. The formalization establishes that non-dual ontology can accommodate legal structure consistently, determining correspondence requires empirical and normative legal investigation beyond formal proof.

For law and legal philosophy, this formalization provides formally verified alternative to essence-based legal theories that have struggled to explain legal change, justify legal authority, ground property rights, and resolve interpretive controversies. The framework shows law can maintain its social functions while acknowledging its phenomenal-conventional nature as presentations arising from conditions rather than as essential structures discovered in nature of justice or morality. Legal practice continues but legal understanding transforms when law is recognized as phenomenal coordination-system serving human flourishing rather than as essential normative-order demanding obedience.
