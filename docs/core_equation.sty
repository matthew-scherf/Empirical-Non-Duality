# The Core Equation of Empirical Non-Duality

\[
\forall p \; [\, \text{Phenomenon}(p) \Rightarrow \text{Inseparable}(p, \Omega) \,]
\]

---

### Definitions

\[
\exists! s \; \text{Substrate}(s)
\]

\[
\Omega = \text{the unique } s \text{ such that } \text{Substrate}(s)
\]

\[
\text{Inseparable}(x, y) \;\Leftrightarrow\; \exists s \big(\text{Substrate}(s) \land \text{Presents}(x, s) \land y = s \big)
\]

---

### Interpretation

Every phenomenon is inseparable from the one unique substrate **Ω**.  
All that appears is the substrate itself, presenting as appearance.  
There are not two — only One reality, expressed in many modes.
