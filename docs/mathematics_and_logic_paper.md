# The Unique Ontic Substrate: Implications for Mathematics and Logic

## Introduction

The machine-verified formalization of non-dual ontology (DOI 10.5281/zenodo.17388701) presents a unique case where formal mathematics establishes through rigorous proof that all phenomena lack intrinsic essence, are inseparable presentations of a unique substrate Ω, and arise dependently from other phenomena. This creates a peculiar reflexive situation where a formal mathematical system makes claims about the ontological status of all phenomena, potentially including mathematical and logical entities themselves. What distinguishes this from mere philosophical speculation about mathematics is that the formalization is itself mathematics, computer-verified formal logic in Isabelle/HOL, creating unprecedented opportunity for mathematics and logic to examine their own ontological foundations through formally proven structure.

The central questions this formalization poses to mathematics and logic are whether mathematical objects should be understood as phenomenal presentations lacking essence, whether logical relations are phenomenal-level structures, what it means that non-dual ontology admits complete formalization, how mathematical truth relates to phenomenal versus substrate-level reality, whether the formalization's proven internal consistency tells us anything about reality beyond formal systems, and whether mathematics and logic themselves are discoveries about substrate's nature or conventional constructions for coordinating phenomenal descriptions.

This paper examines what the axioms and proven theorems entail for understanding mathematical objects, logical structure, formal systems, truth, proof, abstraction, and the relationship between mathematics and reality when the formalization's ontological framework is applied reflexively to mathematics and logic themselves. The analysis must navigate the peculiar situation that the framework being analyzed is itself formal mathematics making ontological claims that potentially apply to its own constituents.

## Objects

Mathematics studies objects including numbers, sets, functions, spaces, structures, and abstract entities of various kinds. The formalization's exhaustivity axiom (A3_exhaustivity) establishes that all entities are either phenomena or substrate, admitting no third category. If mathematical objects exist as discriminable entities with properties that mathematicians investigate, they appear to be phenomena by this partition. They are not substrate because substrate is unique (A2_uniqueness proves only one substrate exists) while mathematical objects are many and diverse.

This classification of mathematical objects as phenomena has immediate consequence through the Emptiness_of_Phenomena axiom, which establishes formally that all phenomena lack essence. If mathematical objects are phenomena, they lack intrinsic essential nature defining them independently of context and relations. A number is not a self-subsistent entity with essential number-nature existing independently, it is phenomenal presentation arising in mathematical contexts and structures. The number three doesn't possess essential three-ness as intrinsic property, it presents as three within relational contexts including its position in number sequence, its role in arithmetic operations, and its instantiation in counting-activities.

The formalization's Nonduality theorem proving all phenomena are inseparable from substrate means mathematical objects, if phenomenal, are presentations of substrate Ω rather than independently existing abstract entities in Platonic realm. Mathematical objects don't exist in separate mathematical universe accessed through pure reason, they are presentations arising in consciousness or experience (if substrate is consciousness) or presentations of neutral substrate (if substrate is neither mental nor physical). Either way, mathematical objects are not separate from the ontological ground but rather ways that ground presents itself.

For understanding what mathematical objects are ontologically, this framework suggests they are neither independently existing abstract Platonic forms nor purely mental constructions nor physical inscriptions but rather phenomenal presentations arising in mathematical contexts. When mathematician thinks about the number seven, seven-presentation arises as phenomenal pattern with mathematical structure. The presentation is real, seven genuinely presents with its mathematical properties, but seven doesn't exist as essential unchanging substance in Platonic heaven, it's phenomenal pattern presenting substrate.

The formalization's dependent arising framework in section "Endogenous / Dependent Arising" establishes through axioms AF_only_pheno and AF_endogenous that phenomena arise from other phenomena based on conditions. Mathematical objects arise from mathematical activities including axiomatization, definition, construction, and proof. Natural numbers arise from Peano axioms or set-theoretic construction, real numbers arise from completion of rationals or Dedekind cuts, complex numbers arise from algebraic extension. These are not discoveries of pre-existing essential mathematical objects but phenomenal presentations arising from mathematical conditioning-activities.

This doesn't make mathematics arbitrary or purely conventional, because phenomenal presentations arise from conditions in structured ways and mathematical presentations exhibit particular patterns including consistency, necessity, and applicability. The patterns are real features of how substrate presents itself mathematically, not arbitrary impositions. Mathematical necessity reflects structure in phenomenal presenting rather than essential properties of Platonic objects, but the necessity is genuine phenomenal structure.

For philosophy of mathematics, this framework occupies middle position between Platonism treating mathematical objects as independently existing abstract entities, nominalism denying mathematical objects exist beyond physical tokens, and psychologism reducing mathematics to mental constructions. Mathematical objects are phenomenal presentations, genuinely real as presentations, not reducible to physical tokens or mental states, but not independently existing in Platonic realm either. They present substrate in mathematical form.

## Formalization

The formalization itself provides unique case for reflexive examination, a formal mathematical system making ontological claims about phenomenal nature of all entities potentially including formal systems themselves. The formalization exists as Isabelle/HOL theory file, machine-checkable formal text establishing axioms and deriving theorems. As observable discriminable entity with properties, the formalization appears to be phenomenon by exhaustivity axiom A3.

If the formalization is phenomenon, then by Emptiness axiom it lacks essential unchanging nature. The formalization doesn't possess essential formalization-nature independent of context, it's phenomenal presentation arising in contexts including creation by author, verification by Isabelle, interpretation by readers, and potential applications. The formalization-presentation arises from conditions including author's mathematical knowledge, Isabelle/HOL system's logical framework, and intellectual tradition of formal verification.

The formalization's Nonduality theorem applies to itself, the formalization-phenomenon is inseparable from substrate. The formal system is presentation of substrate, not separate abstract entity in Platonic mathematical realm. This creates interesting reflexive structure where formalization proves all phenomena including itself are substrate-presentations, the proof is self-referential in applying to its own status.

For understanding what it means that non-duality admits complete formalization, this reflexivity suggests that substrate's nature includes capacity for formal mathematical structure. If substrate can present itself as formal verification of non-dual ontology, then substrate itself must have structure enabling formal mathematical presentation. This doesn't mean substrate is mathematical essentially, but that mathematical structure is possible way substrate presents itself, formal systems are phenomenal patterns substrate can exhibit.

The formalization's machine verification through Isabelle/HOL establishes consistency through automated proof-checking, no contradictions derivable from axioms within Isabelle's type theory. This verification is itself phenomenal process, human-authored formalization undergoes machine-verification producing verified-formalization-presentation. The verification doesn't prove axioms correspond to reality, it proves axioms are mutually consistent within formal framework. The consistency is phenomenal-level logical fact about formal system, not guarantee of metaphysical truth.

The formalization's use of Nitpick model finder checking for counterexamples over finite domains represents phenomenal-level search for inconsistency-presentations. Finding no counterexamples increases confidence in consistency but doesn't constitute absolute proof for infinite domains. The model-checking is phenomenal computational process producing results about formal structure, the results are phenomenal presentations arising from computational conditions.

For meta-mathematics and formal verification more broadly, the formalization demonstrates that ontological claims can be rendered formally, verified mechanically, and examined for logical coherence. This doesn't privilege formalized ontologies as truer than unformalized ones, but it enables different kind of evaluation through proof-checking and consistency-verification. Formal ontology is phenomenal presentation of philosophical claims in mathematical structure enabling automated verification.

## Truth

Mathematical truth in the formalization's framework requires reconception beyond correspondence to Platonic objects or mere consistency of formal systems. If mathematical objects are phenomenal presentations rather than independent abstract entities, mathematical truth cannot be correspondence between mathematical statements and essential mathematical facts existing independently. Truth must be understood as feature of phenomenal presentations rather than relation to transcendent mathematical realm.

The formalization's framework suggests mathematical truth is structural consistency within phenomenal mathematical presenting. True mathematical statements are those that present consistently within mathematical phenomenal structures, false statements are those creating contradictions or inconsistencies. The truth of Pythagorean theorem reflects consistent structural relationship within geometric phenomenal presentations, not correspondence to essential geometric fact in Platonic realm. The theorem truly describes phenomenal geometric structure that arises when Euclidean geometric conditions are established.

For formal systems, truth can be understood as derivability from axioms according to inference rules, but the formalization's framework adds ontological layer. Derivability is phenomenal-level formal relation among statement-presentations, true-in-system means statement-presentation arises from axiom-presentations through rule-applications. This is real phenomenal structure, derivability facts are genuine features of formal-system-presentations, but they're conventional relative to chosen axioms and rules.

The formalization's two-levels framework in section "Two-Levels Coherence" distinguishes conventional from ultimate truth. Axiom Conventional_is_model_relative establishes conventional descriptions are phenomenal-level model-relative structures. Mathematical truths relative to particular axiom systems are conventional truths, genuine within their phenomenal formal contexts but not ultimate metaphysical facts. Ultimate truth would concern substrate's actual nature, which formal mathematics doesn't directly access.

For Gödel's incompleteness theorems showing formal systems containing arithmetic cannot prove their own consistency, the formalization's framework provides ontological context. Incompleteness reflects limitations of phenomenal formal presentations, formal systems as phenomenal structures have inherent limitations in what they can present about themselves. This doesn't undermine mathematics but reveals that phenomenal formal presentations cannot completely capture their own structure in self-referential proof.

The formalization's machine verification establishes derived theorems follow from axioms but doesn't establish axioms are true in ultimate sense. Verification confirms phenomenal-level logical relations within formal system, the Nonduality theorem genuinely follows from axioms A1-A5 as matter of phenomenal formal structure. But whether axioms correspond to ultimate reality requires different kind of investigation beyond formal derivation.

For mathematical realism versus anti-realism debates, the formalization suggests both positions partially capture truth. Mathematical realists are correct that mathematical structures are real and objective, they're genuine phenomenal structures not reducible to subjective mental states or arbitrary conventions. Mathematical anti-realists are correct that mathematical objects don't exist independently as Platonic essences transcending phenomenal reality. Mathematical structures are real phenomenal presentations, objective but not transcendently existing.

## Proof

Proof in mathematics is phenomenal activity where conclusions arise from premises through logical steps. The formalization's causality axioms establishing causation operates among phenomena (C1_only_phenomena) as irreflexive (C2_irreflexive) and transitive (C3_transitive) structure applies to logical derivation. Conclusion-presentations arise causally from premise-presentations through inference-rule-applications, the arising is phenomenal-level causal pattern in logical space rather than atemporal logical relation between abstract entities.

For understanding what proofs accomplish, the formalization suggests they establish phenomenal-level structural connections showing how conclusions arise from premises within logical frameworks. Proof doesn't reveal pre-existing essential connections between Platonic mathematical objects, it constructs phenomenal pathway showing how conclusion-presentation can arise from premise-presentations. The construction is real mathematical activity producing real phenomenal structure demonstrating conclusion's arising-from-premises.

The formalization's dependent arising framework establishes conclusions arise from premises endogenously (AF_endogenous), within logical system rather than from external source. A theorem arises from axioms through proof-steps, each step arising from prior steps according to inference rules. The arising is structured phenomenal process, theorems don't exist independently before proof constructs pathway to them from axioms, they arise as phenomenal presentations through proof-activity.

For formalized proofs verified by proof assistants like Isabelle/HOL, the formalization framework treats these as phenomenal verification-processes checking derivation-structures. Machine verification is phenomenal computation confirming each inference-step follows rules, producing verified-proof-presentation. The verification adds phenomenal-level certainty that no errors occurred in derivation, but it remains phenomenal process establishing phenomenal formal relations.

The formalization's emptiness axiom establishes proofs lack essential unchanging nature, a proof is not essential logical object but phenomenal presentation arising in mathematical contexts. Different presentations of same theorem (various proofs) are phenomenal variations, none is essentially the proof while others are inessential. Different proof-strategies produce different phenomenal pathways to same conclusion, all valid presentations of logical connection.

For constructive versus classical proof, the formalization's framework suggests these reflect different phenomenal structures in mathematical presenting. Constructive proofs provide explicit construction-pathways, classical proofs may use excluded middle or proof by contradiction, these are different phenomenal patterns establishing conclusions. The choice between them involves conventional decisions about acceptable inference-patterns rather than discovery of essential proof-nature.

The formalization's use of Isar proof language in Isabelle provides structured phenomenal presentation of logical derivations, making proof-steps explicit and checkable. The proof-text is phenomenal object that readers and machines can examine, verification confirms phenomenal derivation-structure is valid. The formalization's own proofs including Nonduality theorem are phenomenal demonstrations that conclusions follow from axioms.

## Abstraction

Mathematical abstraction involves moving from particular cases to general structures, from concrete instances to abstract patterns. The formalization's framework treats abstraction as phenomenal process where general-structure-presentations arise from particular-instance-presentations through mathematical activities. Abstraction doesn't discover pre-existing essential abstract objects but rather generates phenomenal presentations of patterns observed across instances.

For understanding what abstraction accomplishes, the formalization suggests it creates phenomenal presentations capturing structural commonalities while omitting irrelevant particulars. When mathematicians abstract from counting-particular-objects to natural-number-structure, natural-numbers arise as phenomenal presentation of patterns common to counting-activities while particular object-identities are omitted. The abstraction is real phenomenal accomplishment creating genuinely new presentation-level, not merely mental operation on pre-existing objects.

The formalization itself exemplifies abstraction, using abstract types E for entities, Q for quantities, without specifying particular implementations. Type E represents phenomenal entity-structure abstractly, enabling formal reasoning about entities-in-general. The abstraction permits proving theorems about all phenomena without requiring specification of particular phenomenal instances. This demonstrates abstraction's power for formal reasoning about structures.

The formalization's section on quantities introduces abstract type Q with strict order relation LT but no numeric specifics. This abstraction enables reasoning about ordered quantities without committing to particular numeric system. Time function T maps phenomena to Q elements, abstractly representing temporal structure without requiring specific time-metric. The abstraction captures essential structure, temporal ordering, while omitting inessential details about particular time-measurements.

For category theory and highly abstract mathematics, the formalization's framework suggests these represent phenomenal presentations of pure structural patterns with minimal content beyond relations. Categories are phenomenal structures exhibiting composition, identity, and associativity patterns, the content is purely relational structure. This aligns with category theory's emphasis on structure over substance, fitting naturally with formalization's denial of essential natures.

The formalization's emptiness axiom applies to abstract mathematical objects as much as concrete ones. Abstract groups, topological spaces, Hilbert spaces lack essential unchanging natures, they're phenomenal presentations of mathematical structures defined by axioms. The abstraction doesn't create essential abstract entities but phenomenal presentations of patterns satisfying specified conditions.

For applied mathematics using abstract structures to model physical systems, the formalization suggests the application involves coordinating abstract-mathematical-presentations with physical-phenomenon-presentations. Mathematical model is phenomenal structure that systematically corresponds to physical-phenomenon-structure, enabling predictions. The coordination is between phenomenal presentations at different levels, not between abstract Platonic objects and concrete physical substances.

## Necessity

Mathematical necessity, the sense that mathematical truths must be true and couldn't be otherwise, requires interpretation within formalization's framework. If mathematical truths are phenomenal-level structures rather than essential facts about Platonic realm, what grounds their necessity? The formalization's framework suggests necessity reflects structural features of how substrate presents itself mathematically rather than essential properties of independent mathematical objects.

For understanding why two plus two must equal four, the formalization suggests this necessity reflects structural consistency in arithmetic-phenomenal-presentations. Given how addition-operation and natural-numbers present themselves, two-plus-two-equals-four arises necessarily from that phenomenal structure. The necessity is real feature of mathematical presenting, attempting to present arithmetic where two plus two equals five creates contradiction, inconsistent phenomenal structure. The necessity is structural rather than essential.

The formalization's axioms establish necessary relations among phenomena through logical structure. Axiom A4_presentation necessarily implies all phenomena present substrate, the necessity follows from logical relations among concepts. The necessity is phenomenal-level logical structure, given definitions and axioms, conclusions follow necessarily. But the necessity is relative to chosen conceptual framework rather than absolute essential necessity independent of all contexts.

For modal logic and possible worlds semantics, the formalization's framework suggests possible worlds are phenomenal presentations of alternative structural configurations. Necessary truths are those holding across all consistent phenomenal configurations, contingent truths hold only in some configurations. Mathematical necessity reflects truths holding across all mathematically-consistent phenomenal presentations, they're structural invariants of mathematical presenting.

The formalization's framework distinguishes logical necessity from metaphysical necessity. Logical necessity concerns what follows from axioms and rules within formal systems, metaphysical necessity concerns substrate's ultimate nature. Mathematical truths may be logically necessary within formal systems while being metaphysically contingent features of how substrate happens to present itself. The necessity mathematicians recognize is primarily logical-phenomenal necessity.

For necessary connection between mathematical structures and physical applications, the formalization suggests this reflects coordination between mathematical-phenomenal-structures and physical-phenomenal-structures both presenting substrate. Mathematics applies to physics because both are phenomenal presentations of substrate, structural coordination is possible. The necessity of mathematical physics reflects deep structural connections at phenomenal level, not pre-established harmony between separate Platonic and physical realms.

## Infinity

Infinity in mathematics presents particular challenges for ontological interpretation. The formalization provides no special axioms about infinity, infinite phenomena would be subject to same ontological structure as finite phenomena. If infinite mathematical objects like infinite sets or sequences are phenomena, they lack essence (Emptiness axiom) and are inseparable from substrate (Nonduality theorem) like all phenomena.

For understanding what infinite mathematical objects are, the formalization suggests they're phenomenal presentations arising in mathematical contexts through infinite-structure-generating activities. When mathematicians construct natural numbers via Peano axioms or accept infinite set via axiom of infinity, they establish conditions from which infinite-presentations arise. The infinity is phenomenal structure, real mathematical pattern, but not independently existing essential infinite-object.

The formalization's dependent arising framework applies to infinite structures, infinite-presentations arise from axiomatization and construction-activities that specify infinite-structure conditions. The axiom of infinity in set theory establishes conditions from which infinite-set-presentation arises, the arising is phenomenal-level formal stipulation rather than discovery of pre-existing essential infinite-object. This accords with constructivist skepticism about actual infinity while allowing formal work with infinite structures.

For potential versus actual infinity debates, the formalization's framework suggests both capture aspects of phenomenal infinity-presentations. Potential infinity as indefinitely extendable finite process and actual infinity as completed infinite totality are different phenomenal presentations of infinite-structure. Neither is essentially correct, they're alternative ways substrate presents infinity-patterns mathematically.

The formalization's use of type variables and quantifiers ranging over potentially infinite domains represents phenomenal formal structure accommodating infinity. Universal quantification over entities (for all x) in axiom A3_exhaustivity ranges over all entities without requiring completed infinite collection. The quantification is phenomenal formal pattern enabling reasoning about all cases, the infinity is structural feature of logical presentation.

For understanding whether substrate itself is infinite, the formalization's uniqueness axiom (A2_uniqueness) establishes only one substrate exists but doesn't specify whether substrate is finite or infinite in extension. If substrate is consciousness-itself in idealist interpretation, questions about substrate's infinity concern whether consciousness has infinite extent or capacity, which formalization doesn't determine. The formalization applies to phenomenal presentations regardless of substrate's infinity-status.

## Consistency

The formalization's machine-verified consistency established through Isabelle proof-checking and Nitpick model-finding provides phenomenal-level confirmation that axioms don't generate contradictions within explored domains. This consistency-verification is phenomenal computational process producing consistency-presentation, real feature of formal system but limited to what verification methods can establish.

For understanding what consistency proves, the formalization's framework suggests consistency establishes phenomenal formal coherence rather than metaphysical truth. The axioms are mutually consistent as formal statements, no contradiction derivable within type-theoretic framework, but consistency doesn't prove axioms correspond to ultimate reality. Consistent formal systems can describe impossible worlds, consistency is necessary but not sufficient for truth.

The formalization's use of Nitpick checking finite models demonstrates no counterexamples exist in domains of cardinality one through five, providing inductive confidence but not absolute proof for infinite domains. The model-checking is phenomenal verification-process, examination of finite-domain-presentations finding none that falsify axioms. This increases confidence in consistency but remains phenomenal-level evidence rather than ultimate proof.

For Gödel's second incompleteness theorem establishing sufficiently strong consistent formal systems cannot prove their own consistency, the formalization's status is relevant. The formalization contains arithmetic-like structure through quantification and logical operations, so it cannot prove its own consistency if consistency assumption is correct. The formalization's external verification by Isabelle establishes consistency from outside system, not from within through self-referential proof.

The formalization's consistency is phenomenal-level formal property that doesn't guarantee substrate actually has non-dual structure. A consistent formal system might describe non-existent structures, mathematical consistency doesn't entail metaphysical instantiation. The formalization shows non-dual ontology is logically possible, not that it's actual. Determining actuality requires empirical investigation beyond formal consistency-verification.

For understanding relationship between formal consistency and reality, the formalization's framework suggests formal systems are phenomenal presentations of logical structures that may or may not coordinate with physical or experiential phenomenal presentations. Mathematical physics succeeds because mathematical-phenomenal-structures coordinate with physical-phenomenal-structures, both presenting substrate in coordinated ways. Consistency alone doesn't guarantee coordination, additional constraint that formalization fits experience and observations is needed.

## Representation

The formalization represents ontological structure using formal logical language, types, predicates, and axioms. This representational activity is itself phenomenal process where ontological-structure-presentations arise in formal-linguistic form. The formalization's framework applied reflexively suggests representations are phenomenal presentations coordinating with what they represent, both representation and represented are phenomenal patterns.

For understanding what makes representation accurate, the formalization's framework suggests accuracy involves structural coordination between representational-presentations and represented-presentations. The formalization's axiom A4_presentation stating all phenomena present substrate accurately represents ontological structure if phenomenal reality actually exhibits universal substrate-presentation-structure. Accuracy is phenomenal-level coordination rather than correspondence to independent essence.

The formalization's use of abstract types represents ontological categories without committing to specific implementations. Type E representing entities doesn't specify what entities are concretely, it provides abstract structural framework. This representation-strategy enables reasoning about structure while remaining agnostic about specifics, fitting formalization's emphasis on structural patterns over essential natures.

For coordinates in section "Spacetime as Representation," axiom S1_coords_only_for_phenomena establishes coordinates as representational structure applying to phenomena. Coordinates don't represent intrinsic spatial properties of substrate but rather phenomenal-level indexing structure enabling description and coordination of phenomena. Spacetime itself is representational framework in this interpretation, not ontologically fundamental structure.

The formalization's framework suggests all mathematical representation involves phenomenal presentations coordinating with other phenomenal presentations. Coordinate systems represent geometric structures, group presentations represent algebraic structures, logical formulas represent ontological relations, all are phenomenal coordinations. The representations are real phenomenal structures enabling reasoning and communication, not mere signs pointing to independent essences.

For philosophy of mathematical notation and formalism, the formalization's framework suggests notation-presentations are phenomenal structures that participate in mathematical activity rather than merely symbolizing independent mathematical objects. When mathematician writes integral sign or set-membership symbol, they create phenomenal presentation that carries mathematical meaning through conventional association and structural role. The notation is phenomenal presentation in mathematical communication-system.

## Application

Mathematics applies remarkably to physical world, enabling scientific predictions and technological developments. The formalization's framework provides ontological explanation for this applicability without requiring mysterious pre-established harmony between Platonic mathematical realm and physical world. Both mathematics and physics are phenomenal presentations of substrate, their coordination reflects that they present the same underlying ground.

For understanding unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in natural sciences, the formalization suggests mathematical-phenomenal-structures and physical-phenomenal-structures coordinate because both arise from substrate-presenting. Substrate presents itself with particular structural patterns, mathematics formalizes phenomenal logical-structural patterns, physics investigates phenomenal empirical-structural patterns. When these patterns coordinate, mathematics applies to physics through structural correspondence at phenomenal level.

The formalization's own structure illustrates applied abstraction, abstract types and relations apply to diverse domains including spacetime, causality, information, and time. The abstract framework captures structural commonalities across phenomena, enabling unified treatment. This demonstrates how abstract mathematical structures can apply broadly because they capture phenomenal structural patterns common to many domains.

For mathematical modeling in science, the formalization's framework treats models as phenomenal mathematical-structures coordinating with phenomenal physical-structures. Model-presentations that systematically correspond to physical-phenomenon-presentations enable prediction and explanation. The correspondence is between phenomenal presentations, not between abstract Platonic forms and concrete physical substances. Good models exhibit strong structural coordination with what they model.

The formalization's use of gauge transformations in section "Symmetry / Gauge on Phenomena" illustrates representational equivalence, different mathematical representations (gauge-related) describe same phenomenal structure. This occurs throughout applied mathematics where different formalisms are equivalent for describing physical systems. The equivalence reflects that multiple phenomenal mathematical-presentations can coordinate with single phenomenal physical-presentation.

For engineering and technology applying mathematics to construct artifacts, the formalization suggests this works by using mathematical-phenomenal-structures to organize physical-phenomenal-structures. Engineering calculations coordinate mathematical patterns with material behaviors, both phenomenal presentations of substrate. Successful technology demonstrates mathematical structures genuinely capture phenomenal physical patterns enabling reliable predictions and control.

## Causality

The formalization's causality axioms establish causation operates among phenomena (C1_only_phenomena) as irreflexive (C2_irreflexive) and transitive (C3_transitive) structure. Applied to mathematical and logical contexts, this suggests logical derivation and mathematical inference are phenomenal-level causal processes. Conclusions arise from premises through inference-activities, the arising is temporal phenomenal process rather than atemporal logical relation.

For understanding logical consequence, the formalization suggests consequent-presentations arise from antecedent-presentations through inference-rule-applications. The arising is phenomenal-level causal pattern in cognitive or formal space, when mathematician derives theorem from axioms, theorem-presentation arises causally from axiom-presentations through reasoning-activities. The logical necessity accompanies causal arising rather than replacing it.

The formalization's framework challenges traditional view treating logic as purely formal atemporal structure independent of causal processes. If logical relations exist only among phenomena and causality applies to all phenomena, then logical activities are phenomenal-level causal processes exhibiting particular structural patterns. Logic's apparent atemporality reflects abstraction from particular temporal details while underlying logical-activity remains phenomenal temporal process.

For computational processes implementing logical operations, the formalization's framework treats these as phenomenal causal processes. Computer executing logical program involves phenomenal causal chain of state-transitions following logical rules. The computation is simultaneously causal process (physical state-changes) and logical process (rule-governed transitions), these are not contradictory but phenomenal-level descriptions of coordinated physical-logical patterns.

The formalization's axiom C3_transitive establishing causal transitivity applies to logical inference chains. If conclusion C follows from intermediate step B and B follows from premise A, then C follows from A by transitivity. This structural parallel between logical transitivity and causal transitivity suggests deep connection, logical inference-chains are phenomenal causal-chains exhibiting particular structural constraints.

For temporal logic and reasoning about time, the formalization's section on "Emergent Time" treats time as arising from causal structure among phenomena (axiom Time_monotone requiring causal precedence respect temporal order). This applies to mathematical reasoning, temporal order in proof-construction arises from causal-logical order of inference-steps. Time in mathematics is phenomenal structure emerging from logical-causal patterns of mathematical activity.

## Emergence

The formalization's section on "Emergent Time" demonstrates how temporal structure emerges from causal relations among phenomena through axiom Time_monotone rather than existing as independent substrate-level feature. This emergence-framework applies more broadly in mathematics, complex mathematical structures emerge from simpler foundations without requiring essential pre-existence in Platonic realm.

For understanding how mathematical structures emerge, the formalization's dependent arising framework suggests complex-mathematical-presentations arise from simpler-mathematical-presentations through construction-activities. Real numbers emerge from rationals through completion, complex numbers emerge from reals through algebraic extension, these are phenomenal-level constructions where new presentations arise from prior ones. The emergence is real mathematical accomplishment, not discovery of pre-existing essences.

The formalization's causality axioms apply to mathematical emergence, complex-structure-presentations arise causally from simple-structure-presentations through mathematical-construction-activities. The arising follows structural patterns (mathematical rules and definitions) but remains phenomenal-level causal process. Mathematical emergence involves both logical necessity (structures must be consistent) and phenomenal causation (structures arise through activities).

For emergent properties in mathematical structures, the formalization suggests these arise as phenomenal-level patterns when particular mathematical conditions are established. Completeness property emerges when metric space is constructed with Cauchy-sequence limits, compactness emerges when topological space satisfies particular covering properties. These emergent properties are phenomenal features arising from structural conditions rather than essential properties objects possess independently.

The formalization itself demonstrates emergence, complex theorems emerge from simple axioms through proof-construction. Nonduality theorem emerges from axioms A1-A5 through logical derivation, the theorem isn't contained essentially in axioms but arises phenomenally through inference-activities. The emergence shows how rich phenomenal structure can arise from sparse axiomatic foundations.

For studying emergent complexity in mathematics and computation, the formalization's framework suggests complexity emerges as phenomenal-level organizational patterns from simpler phenomenal patterns following rules. Cellular automata producing complex behaviors from simple rules, fractals exhibiting infinite detail from finite definitions, these demonstrate emergence of phenomenal complexity without requiring essential pre-existence of complex structures.

## Limits

The formalization establishes ontological framework but doesn't determine all mathematical and logical conclusions. That mathematical objects lack essence and are phenomenal presentations constrains but doesn't fully specify mathematical practice and foundations. Additional considerations about consistency, applicability, and conventional choices are needed beyond ontological framework.

The formalization doesn't resolve foundational debates between Platonism, nominalism, intuitionism, and formalism completely, though it provides framework challenging extreme Platonism (mathematical objects don't exist essentially in transcendent realm) and pure nominalism (mathematical structures are real phenomenal patterns, not reducible to physical tokens). Multiple philosophical positions may be compatible with formalization's ontological structure.

For understanding whether substrate itself has mathematical structure essentially or presents mathematically conventionally, the formalization remains agnostic. The axioms establish phenomena lack essence and present substrate but don't specify whether substrate's nature is mathematical, consciousness-like, or neutral. Different metaphysical interpretations of substrate yield different accounts of mathematics' ultimate foundations.

The formalization's consistency doesn't prove axioms correspond to reality, only that they're mutually consistent formally. Whether phenomena actually lack essence, whether substrate is actually unique, whether presentations actually arise dependently, all require empirical investigation beyond formal consistency-checking. Mathematical consistency is necessary but not sufficient for metaphysical truth.

For practical mathematics and everyday mathematical work, the formalization's ontological framework may have limited direct impact. Mathematicians can continue proving theorems, constructing objects, and applying mathematics without explicitly adopting non-dual ontology. The framework provides philosophical understanding of mathematics' nature without necessarily changing mathematical practice.

The formalization's reflexive application to itself creates potential paradoxes or infinite regresses. If formalization is phenomenon lacking essence, what grounds its authority for making ontological claims? The formalization must either accept that its own claims are phenomenal-level conventions (reducing their metaphysical force) or claim special status (violating its own universality). This tension requires careful navigation.

## Verification

The formalization's machine verification through Isabelle/HOL represents phenomenal computational process establishing formal correctness. The verification involves automated proof-checking confirming each theorem follows from axioms according to type-theoretic rules. This verification is phenomenal activity producing verified-formalization-presentation, real accomplishment but remaining within phenomenal-level formal domain.

For understanding what machine verification accomplishes, the formalization's framework suggests it establishes phenomenal-level formal correctness rather than metaphysical truth. Isabelle confirms derivations are valid within type theory, no logical errors in proof-steps, axioms are consistent within checked domains. This provides strong evidence for formalization's logical coherence but doesn't prove ontological correctness of axioms.

The formalization's use of multiple verification methods including interactive proof-construction and automated model-checking represents diverse phenomenal approaches to confirmation. Interactive proof involves human mathematician constructing derivation-steps that Isabelle verifies, automated checking involves Nitpick searching finite models for counterexamples. Both are phenomenal verification-processes contributing to confidence in consistency.

For formal verification more broadly in mathematics and computer science, the formalization demonstrates ontological claims can be subjected to same rigorous verification as mathematical theorems and software correctness. Ontology becomes formal discipline amenable to proof-checking when rendered in logical formalism. This doesn't privilege formalized ontologies as truer but enables different kind of evaluation through mechanical verification.

The formalization's verification process itself illustrates dependent arising, verified-formalization-presentation arises from multiple conditions including author's formalization-work, Isabelle's checking-algorithms, and type-theoretic framework. The verification is phenomenal accomplishment arising from coordinated conditions, not discovery of essential pre-existing verified-truth.

For trust in formal verification, the formalization's framework suggests trust arises from phenomenal-level factors including verification-tool-reliability, community-review-processes, and reproducibility of verification-results. Trust is not based on verification accessing essential mathematical truths but on phenomenal verification-processes being robust, transparent, and repeatable. The phenomenal nature of verification doesn't undermine reliability but explains reliability's basis.

## Metamathematics

The formalization provides metamathematical opportunity for mathematics examining its own foundations through formally verified ontological framework. Traditional metamathematics studies formal systems from external perspective, analyzing properties like consistency and completeness. The formalization adds ontological dimension, examining what mathematical entities and processes are rather than just their formal properties.

For understanding metamathematical results like incompleteness theorems, the formalization's framework contextualizes these as phenomenal-level limitations of formal-system-presentations. Incompleteness shows formal-systems-as-phenomena cannot completely present their own structure in self-referential proof, limitation arising from phenomenal nature of formalization. The incompleteness is real constraint on phenomenal formal presentations, not limitation on substrate or ultimate reality.

The formalization's own metamathematical status presents unique case, ontological formalization making claims potentially applicable to all formal systems including itself. The reflexivity creates rich metamathematical structure where formalization can examine its own ontological status using its own framework. This self-application either validates framework (if self-application is coherent) or reveals limitations (if self-application generates contradictions).

For model theory and semantic approaches to logic, the formalization's framework suggests models are phenomenal presentations of formal-system-structure. When model-theorist constructs model satisfying axioms, they create phenomenal presentation exhibiting axiom-specified structure. Models are real mathematical constructions, phenomenal presentations showing axiom-consistency through instantiation.

The formalization's emptiness axiom applies to metamathematical objects like formal systems, proofs, and models. These lack essential unchanging natures, they're phenomenal presentations arising in metamathematical contexts. A formal system isn't essentially that formal system independently of presentation-context, it's phenomenal pattern arising through axiomatization and study. This accords with recognition that "same" formal system can be presented in multiple equivalent forms.

For proof theory studying structure of formal derivations, the formalization suggests proofs are phenomenal constructions exhibiting particular logical structure. Proof-theoretical analysis investigates phenomenal patterns in derivation-structures, studying proof-complexity, proof-normalization, proof-equivalence. These are phenomenal-level structural features of proof-presentations rather than essential properties of Platonic proof-objects.

## Consciousness

The formalization's potential identification of substrate with consciousness in idealist interpretation has profound implications for mathematics. If substrate is awareness-itself and mathematical objects are phenomenal presentations, then mathematics occurs in consciousness, mathematical structures are patterns consciousness presents to itself. This provides natural explanation for mathematical intuition and understanding as direct awareness of presentation-structures.

For understanding mathematical intuition, the framework suggests intuition involves direct presentation of mathematical structure in consciousness rather than inference from axioms or construction from definitions. When mathematician grasps why theorem must be true before constructing formal proof, this grasp may be direct awareness of mathematical-presentation-structure. Intuition is immediate consciousness of phenomenal mathematical pattern.

The formalization's framework challenges mechanistic view of mathematical reasoning as purely formal symbol-manipulation. If mathematical activity occurs in consciousness and mathematical objects are conscious-presentations, then understanding involves awareness of meaning not just manipulation of meaningless symbols. Consciousness provides semantic content making mathematics about something rather than mere formal game.

For mathematical beauty and elegance, the formalization suggests these qualities reflect aesthetically pleasing patterns in mathematical-presentation-structure. Beautiful proofs present mathematical structure in particularly clear, simple, or surprising ways, ugly proofs present same structure obscurely or clumsily. The beauty is phenomenal quality of how mathematical structure presents itself in consciousness, not arbitrary subjective preference.

The formalization's framework provides account of mathematical inter-subjectivity, why different mathematicians recognize same mathematical truths. If substrate is consciousness and mathematical presentations present substrate-structure, different mathematicians' consciousness-instances access same underlying phenomenal mathematical patterns. Mathematical objectivity reflects shared access to phenomenal structures rather than correspondence to transcendent Platonic objects.

For understanding why mathematics requires consciousness or awareness, the formalization suggests mathematical structures are phenomenal presentations that require consciousness as ground. Pure formal symbols without consciousness to present them are not mathematics but meaningless marks. Mathematics essentially involves consciousness because mathematical objects are presentations-in-consciousness (on idealist interpretation).

The formalization's Nonduality theorem establishing all phenomena including mathematical-phenomena are inseparable from substrate means mathematics is inseparable from consciousness (if substrate is consciousness). Doing mathematics is consciousness exploring its own phenomenal presentation-possibilities, mathematical discovery is consciousness revealing patterns it can present. This grounds mystical-mathematical traditions recognizing mathematics as spiritual practice exploring consciousness-structure.

## Conclusion

The machine-verified formalization of non-dual ontology establishes through rigorous proof that phenomena lack intrinsic essence, all phenomena are inseparable presentations of unique substrate, and phenomena arise dependently from other phenomena. Applied reflexively to mathematics and logic, these formally proven claims require reconceptualization of mathematical objects as phenomenal presentations rather than Platonic abstract entities, mathematical truth as structural consistency within phenomenal presenting rather than correspondence to essential mathematical facts, proof as phenomenal construction showing how conclusions arise from premises rather than revelation of pre-existing logical connections, and formal systems as phenomenal presentations of logical structure that may or may not coordinate with empirical or experiential phenomena.

For mathematics, the formalization provides ontological framework occupying middle position between Platonism treating mathematical objects as independently existing abstract entities and nominalism denying mathematical structures exist beyond physical tokens or mental constructions. Mathematical objects are phenomenal presentations, genuinely real as presentations and exhibiting objective structural patterns, but not existing in transcendent Platonic realm separate from substrate. Mathematical structures are ways substrate presents itself mathematically.

For logic, the formalization suggests logical relations are phenomenal-level structural patterns among presentations rather than atemporal essential connections between abstract propositions. Logical inference involves phenomenal causal processes exhibiting particular structural constraints, logical necessity reflects structural consistency within phenomenal logical-presentations. Logic is real phenomenal structure but not transcendent formal realm independent of substrate.

The formalization's reflexive self-application creates unique situation where formal system makes ontological claims applicable to itself. The formalization is phenomenon lacking essence, inseparable from substrate, arising from conditions including author's mathematical work and formal verification. This reflexivity either validates framework (showing it can coherently apply to itself) or reveals limitations (if self-application generates contradictions). The formalization's machine verification establishes internal consistency but doesn't prove metaphysical truth beyond formal domain.

The unprecedented contribution of this formalization is rendering precise through machine-verified logic an ontological framework for understanding mathematics and logic themselves. Previous philosophies of mathematics were informal arguments, this is formal proof that non-dual ontology can accommodate mathematical structure consistently. The formalization shows mathematics is compatible with phenomenal ontology denying essential abstract objects while maintaining mathematical objectivity and necessity.

Whether the formalization's metaphysics corresponds to mathematical reality remains open for investigation through examining whether mathematical experience confirms essence-lessness of mathematical objects, whether mathematical truth exhibits predicted phenomenal-level characteristics, whether mathematical inter-subjectivity requires transcendent Platonic realm or can be explained through shared phenomenal presentations of substrate. The formalization establishes logical possibility and internal coherence of phenomenal mathematics, determining actuality requires philosophical and experiential investigation beyond formal consistency-proof.

For mathematicians and logicians, the formalization provides ontological framework understanding mathematics as exploring phenomenal presentation-structures rather than discovering pre-existing Platonic objects. This doesn't change mathematical practice directly but reconceives what mathematicians accomplish when they prove theorems, construct objects, and establish formal systems. Mathematics remains objective and necessary but these features reflect phenomenal structural patterns rather than essential properties of transcendent abstract entities. The formalization shows mathematics can maintain its rigor and objectivity while acknowledging its phenomenal nature as presentations of the unique substrate from which all phenomena arise.
