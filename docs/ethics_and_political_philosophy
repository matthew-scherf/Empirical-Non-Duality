# Formal Non-Dual Ontology: Implications for Ethics and Political Philosophy

## Introduction

The machine-verified formalization of non-dual ontology (DOI 10.5281/zenodo.17388701) establishes through rigorous proof that all phenomena lack intrinsic essence, are inseparable presentations of a unique substrate Î©, and arise dependently from other phenomena within that substrate. These formally proven claims have profound and unsettling implications for ethics and political philosophy, requiring reconceptualization of moral responsibility, personal identity, rights, justice, property, political boundaries, and the relationship between individual and collective. What distinguishes this analysis from philosophical speculation is that every implication follows deductively from axioms verified mechanically to be internally consistent, the formalization is formal mathematics rather than normative argument, yet its descriptive metaphysical claims constrain what normative frameworks can coherently maintain.

The central challenge this formalization poses to ethics and political philosophy is whether moral and political categories can survive the dissolution of essence-based ontology. If moral agents lack intrinsic unchanging essence, what grounds moral responsibility for actions? If persons have no essential nature, what justifies rights attributed to personhood? If boundaries between individuals are phenomenal conventions rather than ontological facts, what becomes of individual liberty and autonomy? If ownership is conventional rather than ontological, what legitimates property rights and distributive justice? If political identities lack essence, what grounds claims about group rights, self-determination, and political representation?

These questions cannot be dismissed as merely theoretical, because the formalization provides rigorous logical proof for its ontological claims, not speculative philosophy. The axiom Emptiness_of_Phenomena formally establishes that all phenomena lack essence, the Nonduality theorem proves all phenomena are inseparable from substrate, the ownership axioms demonstrate that ownership is conventional rather than ontological, and the dependent arising framework shows phenomena arise from other phenomena based on conditions. Ethics and political philosophy must either demonstrate how their categories survive these formally proven claims or reconceive their foundations entirely.

## Personhood

The concept of personhood grounds much of ethics and political philosophy, persons are rights-bearers, moral agents, subjects of justice, holders of dignity and autonomy. But the formalization's axiom Emptiness_of_Phenomena states formally that all phenomena lack essence, meaning if persons are phenomena, which they must be as observable entities with causal effects, then persons have no intrinsic essential nature. There is no person-essence that grounds personhood-properties across contexts and conditions.

This doesn't deny persons exist or matter morally, it reconceives what persons are ontologically. Persons are phenomenal presentations, real patterns arising dependently from conditions including biological embodiment, social recognition, developmental history, and relational context. The formalization's section on "Endogenous / Dependent Arising" establishes through axiom AF_endogenous that phenomena arise from other phenomena, persons arise from biological-social-historical conditions, they are not self-subsistent entities with intrinsic personhood-essence but rather presentations emerging from complex causal networks.

The uniqueness of substrate (axiom A2_uniqueness proving only one substrate exists) combined with the Nonduality theorem (proving all phenomena are inseparable from substrate) entails that all persons are presentations of the same substrate. The apparent separateness between persons is phenomenal distinction rather than ontological separation, persons are like waves in ocean, genuinely distinct in phenomenal appearance but not separate from the water that constitutes them all. This doesn't collapse individual distinctness, waves really are distinct from each other in their patterns and properties, but their distinctness doesn't require substantial separation from underlying unity.

For ethics, this raises the question of whether moral value attaches to persons qua phenomena or to substrate underlying them. If persons are presentations of substrate and substrate is unique, then harming one person is ultimately affecting the substrate that also presents as oneself and all others. The conventional boundary between self and other that enables egoistic indifference to others' suffering rests on false reification of phenomenal boundary as ontological separation. The formalization doesn't directly entail altruism or benevolence, but it removes ontological foundation for treating others as absolutely separate from oneself.

The formalization's treatment of concepts in section "Concepts / Annotations" establishes that concepts are annotations applying to phenomena without reifying them (axiom Concepts_are_annotations and lemma Concepts_don't_reify). The concept "person" is annotation applied to certain phenomenal presentations, useful for coordinating social practices like rights-attribution and responsibility-assessment, but not corresponding to essential property that some entities possess and others lack. This suggests personhood is gradable and context-dependent rather than binary and essential.

For practical ethics this has implications for debates about moral status of fetuses, nonhuman animals, artificial intelligence systems, and severely cognitively impaired humans. If personhood is not essential property but rather phenomenal presentation-structure assessed conventionally, then disputes about who counts as person cannot be resolved by discovering essential personhood-property. Instead, personhood-attribution is conventional decision about which presentations warrant person-treatment, informed by phenomenal characteristics like self-awareness and suffering-capacity but not determined by essential nature.

The formalization doesn't settle these normative disputes but reveals their actual structure, we're deciding conventional boundaries rather than discovering essential facts. This makes personhood-disputes genuinely ethical and political rather than metaphysical, they concern what conventions we should adopt given phenomenal presentations we encounter, not what essential properties entities possess. The shift from discovering essence to deciding convention places ethical responsibility more squarely on communities making these determinations.

## Responsibility

Moral responsibility traditionally requires that agents be causa sui to some degree, capable of acting from their own essential nature rather than being wholly determined by external causes. But the formalization's causality axioms establish that all causation operates among phenomena (C1_only_phenomena), substrate itself stands outside causal relations. If persons are phenomena, then personal agency is phenomenal-level causation, thoughts and intentions and decisions are phenomena causing behavior-phenomena.

The formalization's axiom C2_irreflexive establishes causation is irreflexive, no phenomenon causes itself, and C3_transitive establishes transitivity, if A causes B and B causes C then A causes C. Applied to moral agency, this means agents don't cause themselves ex nihilo but rather arise from prior conditions and their current states cause subsequent actions. Decisions arise from prior thoughts, emotions, values, and circumstances, they don't emerge from uncaused essential agent-substance making libertarian free choices.

But the formalization also excludes hard determinism as traditionally understood, because determinism presupposes substantial entities with intrinsic causal powers determining outcomes. The emptiness axiom denies essential causal natures, phenomena lack intrinsic powers that necessitate effects. Causation in the formalization is phenomenal-level structure among essence-less presentations, not power-based determination by substantial causes. An agent's decision arises from conditions but those conditions don't possess essence-powers that determine the decision, the arising is phenomenal-level pattern rather than substance-level necessitation.

This framework suggests reconceiving moral responsibility as based on causal connection between agent-phenomena and action-phenomena rather than on libertarian free will or essential agent-nature. An agent is responsible for action when that action arose causally from the agent's phenomenal presentation-structure including intentions, values, beliefs, and character. Responsibility attaches to the causal relationship, not to metaphysically impossible uncaused causing or essential agent-substance.

The formalization's dependent arising framework (axioms AF_only_pheno and AF_endogenous establishing that phenomena arise from other phenomena endogenously within substrate) suggests agents are responsible while also being products of conditions. Holding someone responsible is itself phenomenal intervention that becomes part of conditions from which future behavior arises. Praise and blame are not metaphysically grounded in desert based on essential agency but rather pragmatic responses that shape future presentations by altering conditions.

For criminal justice, this framework challenges retributive punishment based on essential desert. If persons lack essence and actions arise from conditions, then punishment as giving people the suffering they essentially deserve rests on false metaphysics. Punishment is justified only consequentially, by effects on future conditions including deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation. The formalization provides ontological foundation for consequentialist and rehabilitative approaches to justice while undermining retributivism.

However, the formalization doesn't eliminate all grounds for reactive attitudes like resentment, gratitude, and indignation. These are phenomenal presentations arising in response to others' actions, real affective responses to real harmful or beneficial presentations. But the metaphysical sting is removed, we resent harmful action because harm was caused, not because agent essentially deserved to act better and failed. The resentment is phenomenal response that may motivate constructive action, but it shouldn't harden into reifying judgment that person is essentially bad.

The formalization's section on ownership establishing that ownership is conventional (axiom Ownership_is_conventional) rather than ontological applies to ownership of actions and their consequences. We conventionally attribute actions to agents and hold them responsible, this is useful social practice for coordinating behavior and maintaining cooperation, but ultimate ontology doesn't include owned-actions as possessed by essential agent-substances. Responsibility is pragmatic convention grounded in causal patterns, not metaphysical fact grounded in essential ownership.

## Rights

Rights-discourse in political philosophy typically grounds rights in essential human nature, human dignity, or intrinsic value of persons. But if persons lack essence (Emptiness_of_Phenomena axiom), then rights cannot be grounded in essential personhood-properties. There is no unchanging human essence that generates rights across all contexts, rights are not intrinsic properties inhering in persons but rather social-conventional recognitions that certain treatment of person-phenomena is required or prohibited.

The formalization's framework suggests rights are phenomenal-level conventions adopted because they structure how persons-as-presentations are treated in ways that reduce suffering and enable flourishing. Rights-conventions emerge from recognition that person-phenomena have characteristics including suffering-capacity, self-awareness, goal-directedness, and social embeddedness that warrant particular protective responses. But rights don't pre-exist their social recognition as essential properties awaiting discovery, they are conventions constructed through ethical-political deliberation.

This doesn't make rights arbitrary or easily dismissible, because phenomenal characteristics genuinely constrain what rights-conventions make sense. Person-phenomena's capacity for suffering provides reason to recognize rights against torture, their social nature provides reason for association rights, their self-awareness provides reason for autonomy rights. The conventions track real phenomenal features even though those features don't constitute essences generating rights metaphysically.

The formalization's treatment of all phenomena as inseparable presentations of substrate (Nonduality theorem) suggests universal scope for rights-like protections. If all person-presentations are ultimately presentations of the same substrate, then the ground for rights extends to all presentations capable of suffering or having interests, not limited by arbitrary boundaries like species, nationality, or cognitive capacity. The formalization doesn't directly entail universal rights but removes ontological foundation for limiting rights to arbitrarily defined in-groups.

For debates about which entities have rights, the formalization suggests focusing on phenomenal characteristics rather than essential properties. Do animals suffer and have interests? Then rights-like protections may be warranted regardless of whether they possess essential personhood. Do advanced AI systems exhibit suffering-structure and goal-directedness? Then rights-conventions may appropriately extend to them regardless of their substrate being silicon rather than carbon. The question becomes which presentations warrant which protections based on their phenomenal characteristics, not which entities possess essential rights-generating properties.

The formalization's uniqueness of substrate (A2_uniqueness) combined with inseparability of phenomena from substrate (Nonduality theorem) suggests that violating rights of others is ultimately affecting the substrate that is also one's own ground. This doesn't generate rights through logical necessity but removes the ontological separateness that enables viewing others' rights as purely external constraints on self-interest. When harming others one is affecting presentations of the substrate from which one's own presentation arises.

For political philosophy this suggests rights are best understood as conventions that should be adopted because they accord with the phenomenal structure of persons and the ultimate non-separation between apparent individuals. Rights-discourse remains useful pragmatically for coordinating social practices and limiting power, but it's grounded in phenomenal characteristics and conventional decisions rather than essential metaphysics. This makes rights more contestable and revisable, which may be seen as weakness or as honest recognition of rights' actual status.

The formalization also suggests that rights-talk focused on protecting individual separation may need supplementation with recognition of interdependence. If persons are inseparable presentations arising dependently from each other and from substrate, then ethics based purely on non-interference rights misses the ontological interdependence. Positive rights to assistance, solidarity rights, and collective rights may better reflect the phenomenal-ontological structure than purely negative liberty-rights presupposing absolute separation between autonomous individuals.

## Property

The formalization directly addresses ownership in section "Non-Appropriation," establishing through axiom Ownership_is_conventional that ownership is conventional rather than ontological, and through axiom No_ontic_ownership that owned entities are inseparable from substrate and lack essence. This has immediate radical implications for understanding property rights, the foundation of much political philosophy and economic systems.

If ownership is conventional rather than ontological fact, then property rights are social constructs serving pragmatic purposes rather than natural rights grounded in essential relation between person and thing. The formalization doesn't deny property institutions can be useful, conventions enabling productive use of resources, coordinating access, and providing security. But it denies that ownership constitutes ultimate metaphysical relation, at the ontological level there are no owners and owned as separately existing entities in possession-relation.

The formalization's axiom A4_presentation establishing that all phenomena present substrate and the proven theorem Nonduality showing all phenomena are inseparable from substrate mean that neither persons nor possessions exist as separate substances capable of entering ultimate ownership-relation. Both person-phenomena and possession-phenomena are presentations of substrate, their relationship as owner-owned is phenomenal-level conventional structure, not ontological fact about essential natures.

For political philosophy this challenges both left-libertarian and right-libertarian positions that ground property rights in essential relations. Lockean self-ownership and labor-mixing theories presuppose essential relation between person and body, person and labor, person and labored-upon-objects, but the formalization denies these essential relations exist. The body is not ultimately owned by person because both are presentations lacking essence and ownership is conventional. Labor-mixing doesn't generate ontological ownership because mixing is phenomenal-level causal interaction, not essential property-transmission.

Similarly, Marxist critiques of property alienation presupposing essential connection between producer and product that capitalism severs rest on essence-ontology the formalization excludes. If products are phenomenal presentations arising from conditions including labor but lacking essence, there is no essential producer-product bond that alienation violates. Critique of capitalism requires different foundation, perhaps focusing on power relations, suffering distribution, or frustrated human capacities, rather than essential ownership violations.

The formalization suggests property institutions should be assessed purely consequentially, by their effects on suffering, flourishing, and social coordination. Property conventions that concentrate resources in ways producing widespread suffering cannot be justified by appeal to essential ownership-rights, because such rights don't exist ontologically. Property conventions that enable productive use and reduce conflict may be pragmatically justified even though they don't correspond to ontological ownership-facts.

For distributive justice this removes one common foundation, that people essentially own what they produce or acquire through legitimate transfer, and therefore justice requires respecting existing ownership. If ownership is conventional throughout, then current distributions have no essential justification requiring preservation. Distributive questions become purely about what conventions produce best outcomes, whether equality, sufficiency, desert-based distribution, or need-based distribution, without metaphysical constraint from essential ownership.

The formalization's framework also suggests possessiveness and attachment to property may be forms of reification, treating phenomenal conventional ownership as if it were essential unchanging possession. Suffering from loss of possessions may be amplified by reifying ownership as essential relation rather than recognizing its conventional conventional phenomenal nature. This doesn't deny loss hurts, but suggests the metaphysical sting can be reduced by understanding ownership's actual status.

For environmental ethics the formalization's denial of essential ownership undermines claims that humans essentially own nature or have dominion based on essential superiority. Nature-phenomena and human-phenomena are both presentations of substrate, inseparable from same ground. Human claims to own and control nature are phenomenal-level conventions, not ontological facts about essential relations. This supports environmental ethics based on recognizing interdependence and ultimate unity rather than on property rights or stewardship duties presupposing separation.

## Identity

Political philosophy relies heavily on identity-categories including nationality, ethnicity, race, gender, religion, and class to structure claims about representation, rights, justice, and self-determination. But the formalization's emptiness axiom establishing that phenomena lack essence means these identity-categories cannot refer to essential unchanging properties defining persons. Identity is phenomenal presentation-structure arising dependently from conditions rather than essential nature persons possess.

The formalization's dependent arising framework (section "Endogenous / Dependent Arising") establishes that phenomena arise from other phenomena based on conditions (AF_endogenous). Applied to identity, this means identity-presentations arise from historical, social, biological, and personal conditions, they are constructed through processes rather than essential properties discovered. Gender-presentations arise from biological sex characteristics, social gender expectations, personal identification, behavioral patterns, and cultural contexts, not from essential gender-essence persons possess.

This doesn't make identity arbitrary or purely voluntary, because presentations arise from conditions that aren't simply chosen. One doesn't choose biological sex characteristics or cultural context into which one is born, these conditions shape identity-presentations that arise. But identity isn't fixed unchanging essence either, as conditions change identity-presentations can transform. The formalization suggests middle position between essentialism (identity as fixed nature) and voluntarism (identity as pure choice), where identity is phenomenal pattern arising from conditions.

The formalization's Nonduality theorem establishing that all phenomena are inseparable from substrate means all identity-presentations, however different phenomenally, are ultimately presentations of same substrate. The boundaries between identity-groups are phenomenal distinctions rather than ontological separations, useful for recognizing patterns and coordinating action but not corresponding to essential differences in kind. This doesn't deny real phenomenal differences in experience between groups, differences in how substrate presents itself through different identity-positions are real, but the differences don't constitute essential unbridgeable separations.

For politics of recognition and identity-based rights claims, the formalization provides complex implications. On one hand, if identity lacks essence, then claims based on essential nature of identity-groups cannot be maintained, there is no essential women's-nature or essential Black-identity generating particular political entitlements. On other hand, identity-presentations are real phenomenal patterns producing real differential experiences and requiring recognition and response. The formalization suggests identity-politics should focus on recognizing real phenomenal patterns and their effects rather than on discovering or respecting essential identities.

The formalization's treatment of concepts as annotations (section "Concepts / Annotations") that don't reify (lemma Concepts_don't_reify) applies to identity-concepts. Categories like "woman," "Black," "queer," "disabled" are conceptual annotations applied to phenomenal presentations based on salient features, useful for organizing social understanding and political action but not corresponding to essential properties. This supports recognition that identity-boundaries are constructed and contestable, categories shift across contexts and can be resisted or reimagined.

For intersectionality and multiple marginalization, the formalization's framework naturally accommodates the recognition that persons have multiple identity-presentations simultaneously, arising from multiple interacting conditions. There is no essential unified identity but rather overlapping presentation-patterns. Someone presents simultaneously as woman-gendered, Black-raced, working-class, disabled, queer, each arising from different conditioning factors and producing different marginalization-experiences. The formalization's view of persons as essence-less presentations arising dependently from multiple conditions fits intersectional analysis better than essentialist identity-models.

The formalization also suggests that political emphasis on fixed identity-boundaries may involve reification that increases suffering. Treating identity as essential unchanging nature can trap people in limiting self-concepts and prevent transformation. While recognizing identity-based injustice requires acknowledging identity-patterns, liberation may ultimately involve loosening identification with identity-categories as essential self-definitions. This tension between recognition and transcendence of identity characterizes some debates in identity-politics and the formalization provides ontological framework for understanding it.

## Violence

Violence between persons presents acute ethical challenge that the formalization addresses through its ontological framework. When one person harms another, the formalization's Nonduality theorem establishing that all phenomena are inseparable presentations of substrate means the harmer and harmed are ultimately presentations of the same substrate. The violence is one presentation affecting another presentation, both grounded in and inseparable from the same ontological substrate.

This doesn't make violence acceptable or less serious morally, the suffering caused by violence is real phenomenal suffering requiring prevention and response. But it removes ontological foundation for viewing perpetrator as essentially separate other whose suffering and wellbeing are unrelated to one's own. In harming another one is affecting presentation of the substrate that is also one's own ground, the separation enabling violence to feel like affecting merely external other is false reification of phenomenal boundary as ontological gap.

The formalization's causality axioms establishing that causation operates among phenomena (C1) as irreflexive (C2) and transitive (C3) pattern means violent action is phenomenal-level causation from perpetrator-presentation to victim-presentation. The harm caused is real causal effect with real phenomenal consequences including suffering, injury, trauma, and possibly death. The formalization doesn't deny or minimize these causal effects, it contextualizes them ontologically.

The emptiness axiom establishing phenomena lack essence (Emptiness_of_Phenomena) means neither perpetrator nor victim has essential nature as violent-person or victim-person. Someone who commits violence isn't essentially violent, the violent action is phenomenal presentation arising from conditions including their own suffering, social conditioning, circumstances, and choices. This doesn't excuse violence but suggests perpetrators are essence-less presentations capable of transformation rather than essentially evil beings requiring only punishment or elimination.

For victims, the formalization suggests that while trauma and harm are real phenomenal effects, they don't constitute essential damage to unchanging self-nature because self lacks essence. Healing involves transformation of harm-presentations arising through processing trauma, developing safety, building resources, not restoration of essential undamaged nature that was lost. This framework supports trauma-informed approaches recognizing both reality of harm and possibility of transformation.

The formalization's dependent arising framework (AF_endogenous axiom) suggests violence arises from conditions including perpetrator's own suffering, social systems enabling violence, cultural normalization, and structural injustice. Preventing violence requires addressing these conditioning factors, not just punishing individuals as if they were uncaused causes of violence. The causal web producing violence extends beyond individual perpetrators to encompass social structures and historical patterns.

For restorative justice and conflict transformation approaches, the formalization provides ontological support. If perpetrator and victim are both essence-less presentations arising from conditions and ultimately inseparable from substrate, then restoration of relationship and transformation of conditions enabling violence becomes priority over retribution based on essential desert. Restorative practices aim to repair harm at phenomenal level while recognizing ontological non-separation between all involved.

The formalization also suggests that dehumanization enabling violence involves reification error, treating target of violence as essentially other and separate, lacking connection to oneself and substrate. Preventing violence may require cultivating recognition of non-separation, not as abstract philosophy but as lived awareness that harming others is harming presentations of substrate that is also one's ground. This doesn't guarantee non-violence but removes ontological foundation for treating others as absolutely separate and therefore negligible.

For state violence including war, policing, and punishment, the formalization challenges justifications based on essential difference between legitimate violence-users (state) and illegitimate violence-users (criminals, enemies). These distinctions are phenomenal-level conventions serving coordination functions, not essential properties justifying absolute differences in treatment. State violence requires justification by effects on suffering and wellbeing, not by appeal to essential state-authority or essential criminality of targets.

## Justice

Justice as traditionally conceived in political philosophy involves giving each person their due based on essential properties like merit, need, or rights. But if persons lack essence (Emptiness axiom) and ownership is conventional (section "Non-Appropriation"), then justice cannot be grounded in essential desert or essential entitlements. Justice must be reconceived as phenomenal-level coordination of how persons-as-presentations are treated to minimize suffering and enable flourishing.

The formalization's framework suggests consequentialist approaches to justice where distributions and treatments are assessed by their effects on phenomenal presentations rather than by correspondence to essential desert or rights. Just arrangements are those producing less suffering, more flourishing, better conditions for transformation and development, not those respecting essential properties that don't exist. This doesn't make justice purely aggregative utilitarian calculus, because suffering and flourishing have qualitative dimensions requiring recognition, but it grounds justice in effects rather than essences.

Distributive justice questions about how resources should be allocated cannot be resolved by discovering essential ownership-facts (formalization proves ownership is conventional) or essential desert-facts (formalization proves phenomena lack essence). Instead, distributions should be assessed by how they affect conditions from which presentations arise and how they distribute suffering and flourishing. Egalitarian, prioritarian, and sufficientarian principles can be assessed by their phenomenal-level effects rather than justified by essential entitlements.

Retributive justice grounding punishment in essential desert that wrongdoers deserve suffering proportional to their wrongdoing cannot be maintained on formalization's ontology. The emptiness axiom establishing phenomena lack essence means wrongdoers don't have essential nature deserving particular suffering. Punishment may be justified consequentially by deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation, or victim vindication, but not by essential deservingness requiring suffering be imposed.

Procedural justice concerning fair processes for making decisions may be grounded in phenomenal effects rather than essential rights. Fair procedures matter because they affect how persons experience decision-processes, whether they feel respected and heard, whether outcomes are perceived as legitimate, all phenomenal-level effects with consequences for cooperation and stability. Procedural fairness is pragmatic requirement for social coordination rather than essential requirement flowing from autonomy-essence persons possess.

The formalization's Nonduality theorem establishing all phenomena are inseparable from substrate suggests justice should recognize ultimate interdependence between apparent individuals. If persons are presentations of same substrate, then sharp boundaries between individual interests enabling purely procedural justice (neutral processes without concern for outcomes) may be inadequate. Justice may require substantive attention to how distributions affect the substrate presenting as all persons, not just procedural neutrality respecting separate individuals.

For transitional justice addressing mass atrocity and systematic injustice, the formalization suggests focusing on transformation of conditions producing atrocity and restoration of relationship rather than purely on punishment of perpetrators. If perpetrators are essence-less presentations arising from conditions including ideology, authority-structures, and dehumanizing propaganda, then transformation requires changing these conditions. Truth-telling, acknowledgment, reparation, and guarantees of non-recurrence may be more important than individual punishment for producing justice phenomenally.

The formalization also suggests that justice focused purely on distributing goods among separate individuals misses the relational interdependence established by Nonduality theorem. Relational justice attending to quality of relationships, patterns of domination and subordination, recognition and misrecognition, may be more fundamental than distributive justice presupposing separate individuals dividing resources. Just arrangements are those enabling mutual recognition of persons as presentations of substrate rather than as competing separate interests.

## Power

Power in political philosophy is typically understood as capacity to affect others' behavior and circumstances, distributed unequally and producing domination when concentrated. The formalization's ontology provides framework for understanding power as phenomenal-level causal capacity operating among presentations that are ultimately inseparable from substrate. Power-relations are real phenomenal patterns with real causal effects, but they don't constitute essential hierarchies reflecting intrinsic superiorities or inferiorities.

The formalization's causality axioms establishing causation as phenomenal-level relation (C1) that is irreflexive (C2) and transitive (C3) means power operates through causal effects among phenomena. Those with power are positioned to causally affect conditions from which others' presentations arise, shaping possibilities and constraining choices. Power-differences are phenomenal asymmetries in causal capacity, some presentations are positioned to affect many others while many others have minimal capacity to affect them.

The emptiness axiom establishing phenomena lack essence means power-holders don't possess essential superiority justifying power, and the powerless don't have essential inferiority explaining subordination. Power-asymmetries arise from historical, social, economic, and political conditions, they are phenomenal patterns arising dependently rather than essential hierarchies reflecting intrinsic natures. This removes justification for naturalizing power-hierarchies as reflecting how things essentially must be.

The formalization's Nonduality theorem establishing that all phenomena including power-holders and powerless are inseparable presentations of substrate means power-relations are ultimately substrate affecting itself through asymmetric phenomenal patterns. When powerful exploit powerless, this is one presentation-pattern affecting another, both presentations of same substrate. The powerful's wellbeing is not ultimately separable from the powerless's suffering because both are presentations of same ontological ground.

For understanding structural oppression based on gender, race, class, and other identity-categories, the formalization provides framework recognizing these as phenomenal-level patterns arising historically and reproduced through institutions, not as essential natures of groups. Oppression is real phenomenal pattern causing differential suffering and constraint, requiring analysis and resistance, but it's not grounded in essential properties of oppressor-group or oppressed-group. This removes ideological justification for oppression based on natural essential differences while acknowledging oppression's reality.

The formalization's dependent arising framework (AF_endogenous) suggests power-relations arise from and are maintained by conditions including economic structures, legal frameworks, cultural narratives, and individual behaviors. Transforming power-relations requires addressing these conditions, changing how phenomena arise rather than replacing essential rulers with essential ruled. Revolutionary change that only replaces which persons hold power without transforming conditions may reproduce oppressive patterns with different actors.

For resistance to domination, the formalization suggests that while power-holders and oppressed are ultimately inseparable presentations of substrate, phenomenal-level power-asymmetries create real suffering requiring collective action to transform. Recognition of ultimate non-separation doesn't dissolve responsibility to resist domination, but it may shape how resistance operates. If oppressors are essence-less presentations arising from conditions, resistance aims to transform conditions producing oppressor-behavior rather than to destroy essentially evil oppressors.

The formalization also suggests that attachment to power and identification with power-position involve reification, treating power-status as essential property defining self rather than recognizing it as phenomenal pattern arising from conditions. Power-holders may suffer from this reification even as they benefit materially from power, becoming trapped in defending status they've reified as essential to identity. Transformation of power-relations may require power-holders recognizing essence-lessness of their position.

## Community

Political philosophy concerns not just individuals but collectives including communities, nations, peoples, and humanity. The formalization's ontology reconceives collective entities as phenomenal patterns arising from coordinated individual presentations rather than as separate substantial entities with essential natures. Communities are real phenomenal structures but lack essence that would ground absolute boundaries or unchanging identities.

The formalization's exhaustivity axiom (A3) establishing that all entities are either phenomena or substrate means communities, if they exist as observable coordinated patterns, are phenomena. As phenomena they lack essence (Emptiness axiom) and are inseparable from substrate (Nonduality theorem). Communities arise dependently from conditions including shared location, common language, historical experience, and mutual recognition, they are not essential bounded entities with intrinsic group-nature.

For nationalism and claims to national self-determination, the formalization provides complex implications. National communities are real phenomenal patterns producing shared identity and enabling collective action, but they lack essential unchanging national-nature that would absolutely determine boundaries or justify exclusion. National boundaries are phenomenal conventions serving coordination functions, not ontological divisions between essentially different peoples. This doesn't dissolve nations but removes metaphysical foundation for treating national boundaries as sacred unchanging essences.

The formalization's uniqueness of substrate (A2) and inseparability of all phenomena from substrate (Nonduality theorem) suggest humanity as whole is more ontologically fundamental than nations, races, or civilizations. All human presentations are presentations of same substrate, subdivisions are phenomenal conventions useful for various purposes but not corresponding to essential separations. This supports cosmopolitan ethics viewing humanity as fundamental moral community while recognizing that phenomenal-level communities enable goods including belonging, solidarity, and cultural flourishing.

For multiculturalism and cultural rights, the formalization suggests cultures are phenomenal patterns arising historically and transmitted through practice, they lack essential unchanging cultural-nature requiring preservation. Cultures transform continuously as conditions change, cultural boundaries are fluid and contested, cultural content is negotiated rather than discovered. This doesn't make cultures unimportant or protection of cultural practices unjustified, but it removes essentialist foundation that would require preservation of cultures in fixed forms regardless of participants' evolving needs and values.

The formalization's treatment of ownership as conventional (section "Non-Appropriation") applies to collective ownership and territorial claims. Communities don't essentially own territories, ownership is phenomenal-level convention serving pragmatic purposes. Historical occupation provides reason for recognizing territorial claims but not absolute justification based on essential ownership. Indigenous land claims and historical injustice require remedy not because indigenous peoples essentially own land but because displacement caused real phenomenal suffering and current structures perpetuate injustice.

For understanding conflict between communities, the formalization suggests that while communities have real phenomenal differences producing competing interests and genuine conflicts, these don't reflect essential unbridgeable differences requiring perpetual hostility. If communities are essence-less presentations arising from conditions and ultimately inseparable from substrate, transformation of conflict is possible through changing conditions and recognizing underlying connection. This supports conflict transformation approaches over essentialist narratives treating enmity as eternal.

The formalization also suggests that strong identification with community-identity may involve reification, treating community-membership as essential unchanging property defining self. This identification can produce both valuable solidarity and destructive tribalism. The formalization provides framework for appreciating community-belonging as meaningful phenomenal pattern while recognizing its essence-less conventional nature, enabling both solidarity and openness to transformation.

## Freedom

Freedom in political philosophy is typically understood as capacity for self-determination, autonomy from external constraint, or ability to realize essential nature. But the formalization's ontology requires reconceiving freedom because selves lack essence (Emptiness axiom), causation operates among phenomena without uncaused causes (causality axioms), and all phenomena arise dependently from conditions (dependent arising framework).

The formalization excludes libertarian freedom understood as uncaused self-causing, because causality axiom C1_only_phenomena establishes causation operates among phenomena and C2_irreflexive establishes no phenomenon causes itself. Agents don't cause themselves ex nihilo, their choices arise from conditions including prior thoughts, values, circumstances, and character. Freedom cannot be metaphysical independence from causal conditions.

But the formalization also excludes hard determinism that would deny freedom entirely, because phenomena lack essence (Emptiness axiom) that would determine outcomes necessarily. Causation in the formalization is phenomenal-level pattern rather than essence-based necessitation. Choices arise from conditions but aren't necessitated by essential causal powers, the causal arising has structure but not the metaphysical necessity determinism claims.

This suggests compatibilist understanding of freedom where agents are free when their actions arise from their own phenomenal presentation-structure including values, intentions, and character, even though that structure itself arises from conditions. Freedom is absence of external constraint preventing one's presentation-structure from expressing itself in action, not metaphysical independence from causation. One is free when doing what one wants arising from who one is, even though what one wants and who one is arise from conditions.

The formalization's dependent arising framework (AF_endogenous axiom establishing phenomena arise from other phenomena endogenously) suggests freedom involves understanding and potentially transforming the conditions from which one's presentations arise. One isn't free by being uncaused but by understanding causal patterns and cultivating conditions producing desired presentations. Freedom is capacity to shape conditions rather than independence from conditions.

For political freedom, the formalization suggests freedom requires social conditions enabling persons' presentation-structures to express themselves and transform. Oppressive conditions constrain which presentations can arise, limiting persons to narrow range of possibilities. Freedom requires removing constraints and providing resources enabling diverse presentations to arise and flourish. This supports positive freedom concepts requiring not just absence of interference but presence of enabling conditions.

The formalization's Nonduality theorem establishing all phenomena are inseparable from substrate suggests individual freedom is inseparable from collective freedom. If persons are presentations of same substrate, one's freedom to develop and express oneself depends on conditions shaped by others' freedom and constraint. My freedom is affected by your oppression because we're ultimately presentations of same substrate. This suggests freedom is relational and collective rather than purely individual property.

The formalization also suggests that attachment to particular presentation-structure as essential self limits freedom. If one reifies current presentation as essential unchanging nature, one becomes trapped by that reification. Freedom may involve recognizing essence-lessness of all presentations including one's current self-presentation, enabling transformation rather than defensive preservation of identity. This is freedom as fluid engagement with flowing experience rather than as protection of fixed essence.

## Authority

Political authority, the right to command and duty to obey, is traditionally grounded in consent, essential properties of rulers, divine appointment, or beneficial consequences. The formalization's ontology challenges justifications based on essential properties because phenomena lack essence (Emptiness axiom), while allowing consequentialist justifications based on phenomenal effects.

Authority-relations are phenomenal-level patterns where some presentations (authorities) have recognized capacity to direct others' behavior. These patterns arise from conditions including historical development, institutional structures, acceptance by subjects, and capacity to sanction disobedience. Authority is phenomenal convention rather than essential property, no one is essentially qualified to rule and no one essentially owes obedience.

The formalization's Nonduality theorem establishing all phenomena are inseparable from substrate means rulers and ruled are presentations of same substrate, their apparent separation into authority-holders and subjects is phenomenal distinction rather than ontological separation. Authority-hierarchies are not essential orders reflecting intrinsic superiorities but phenomenal patterns that can be assessed by their effects on suffering and flourishing.

For legitimacy of political authority, the formalization suggests consequentialist assessment based on whether authority-structures reduce suffering, enable coordination, protect vulnerable, and facilitate flourishing. Authority is legitimate when it produces better phenomenal outcomes than available alternatives, not because authorities possess essential right to rule. This allows for legitimacy being gradable and contestable, different authorities may be more or less legitimate based on their effects.

The formalization's framework challenges divine right theories grounding authority in essential designation by transcendent source. If substrate is ontological ultimate and phenomena arise dependently from conditions (AF_endogenous), there is no transcendent external source to designate essential rulers. Authority arises from phenomenal-level conditions including tradition, effectiveness, and acceptance, not from essential divine appointment.

Social contract theories grounding authority in consent face question of whether consent can generate authority when persons lack essential unchanging nature to consent. The formalization suggests consent is phenomenal agreement arising from current presentation-structure, but that structure changes as conditions change. Consent may need to be ongoing and renewable rather than one-time essential commitment. This supports democratic arrangements allowing regular reassessment of authority.

For anarchist critiques of authority claiming all hierarchy is unjustified domination, the formalization provides partial support. If authority is phenomenal convention lacking essential justification, all authority-structures require pragmatic justification by effects. But the formalization doesn't prove all authority is domination, phenomenal authority-patterns may reduce suffering and enable coordination even while lacking essential justification. The question is whether particular authority-structures serve phenomenal flourishing or merely concentrate power.

The formalization also suggests that identification with authority-role involves reification, treating authority-status as essential property defining self. Authority-holders may become attached to their position as essential to identity, producing rigidity and resistance to accountability. Similarly, subjects may reify their subordination as essential, producing servility. Recognition of authority's essence-less conventional nature may enable both more humble authority-wielding and more assertive resistance to unjust authority.

## Transformation

Perhaps the most important political implication of the formalization is that transformation of social structures is ontologically possible and may be necessary. Because phenomena lack essence (Emptiness axiom) and arise dependently from conditions (dependent arising framework), no social arrangement is fixed in essential unchanging nature. Current injustices, power-structures, and institutional patterns are phenomenal presentations arising from conditions, they can transform as conditions transform.

The formalization's framework challenges conservative political philosophies grounding existing arrangements in essential natures of persons or societies. If persons and societies lack essence, there is no essential nature that current arrangements express and from which deviation is unnatural. Existing arrangements arose from historical conditions and are maintained by current conditions, they have no essential unchanging status requiring preservation.

The formalization also challenges revolutionary philosophies presupposing essential human nature that current systems suppress and revolution will liberate. If persons lack essential nature, revolution cannot reveal true essential humanity obscured by current systems. Instead, revolution transforms phenomenal conditions from which different presentations can arise. The goal isn't liberating essential nature but changing conditions to enable less suffering and more flourishing presentations.

For social movements seeking transformation, the formalization provides both encouragement and caution. Encouragement because transformation is ontologically possible, no arrangement is essentially fixed beyond change. Caution because transformation requires changing conditions comprehensively, not just replacing personnel in power-positions. If oppressive patterns arise from conditions and phenomena arise dependently, transformation requires transforming the conditioning factors not just the particular phenomena currently present.

The formalization's Nonduality theorem establishing that all phenomena are inseparable from substrate suggests transformation must recognize interdependence. One cannot transform one's own circumstances independently of others because all are presentations of same substrate. Social transformation is necessarily collective, affecting conditions from which all presentations arise. This supports solidarity and coalition-building as necessary for genuine transformation.

The formalization's treatment of causality as operating among phenomena (C1) with irreflexive (C2) and transitive (C3) structure means transformative action has causal effects that propagate. Actions taken to change conditions become part of conditions from which future presentations arise. This provides ground for political agency and hope for effectiveness while recognizing that outcomes arise from causal patterns extending beyond individual control.

For understanding resistance to change, the formalization suggests that reification of current arrangements as essential unchanging nature produces attachment to status quo. When people treat current social forms as essential rather than conventional phenomenal patterns, they resist transformation as threatening reality's essential structure. Recognition of essence-lessness may reduce this resistance by revealing that transformation doesn't violate essential nature but rather changes phenomenal patterns.

The formalization also suggests that utopian visions of perfect final arrangement involve reification, treating some particular social form as essential unchanging ideal. If all phenomena lack essence and arise dependently from changing conditions, no arrangement can be permanently perfect. Social life requires ongoing transformation responding to evolving conditions, not achievement of fixed utopia. Politics is continuous process of transformation rather than project of reaching essential endpoint.

## Limitations

The formalization establishes metaphysical structure but doesn't directly entail specific normative conclusions. That phenomena lack essence, are inseparable from substrate, and arise dependently are ontological claims, they constrain but don't determine ethical and political conclusions. Different normative frameworks may be compatible with the formalization's ontology, and additional ethical premises are needed to generate specific political conclusions.

The formalization doesn't resolve fundamental normative disagreements about what makes outcomes good or valuable. That persons are essence-less presentations of substrate doesn't determine whether wellbeing, equality, freedom, or virtue should be promoted. The formalization removes certain justifications based on essential properties and rights but doesn't provide positive foundation for normative principles. Ethical and political philosophy require both ontological clarity (provided by formalization) and normative argument (not provided by formalization).

The relationship between descriptive ontology and normative ethics is complex. The formalization establishes what persons and social structures are ontologically, but the move from descriptive claims to normative conclusions requires bridging is-ought gap. That persons are inseparable presentations may suggest treating others as connected to oneself, but this suggestion isn't logical necessity. Additional premises about reducing suffering or promoting flourishing are needed.

The formalization's framework may seem to support particular political positions but this appearance requires scrutiny. Both conservative emphasis on interdependence and progressive emphasis on transformation can claim support from the formalization, both resistance to oppression and patience with gradual change may seem warranted, both individual rights and collective solidarity appear important. The formalization's compatibility with diverse political positions may be strength (showing broad applicability) or weakness (lacking specific implications).

For practical political decision-making, the formalization provides ontological framework but doesn't replace political judgment about particular cases. Whether specific policy promotes flourishing, whether particular institution reduces suffering, whether resistance is appropriate in given circumstances, all require empirical assessment and practical wisdom beyond formal ontology. The formalization shapes how we understand politics ontologically but doesn't determine political choices.

The formalization also leaves open whether substrate-identification is consciousness, matter, neutral stuff, or something else. Different identifications may have different ethical implications. If substrate is consciousness-itself, this may support particular ethical conclusions about value of experience and consciousness. If substrate is neutral, different ethical framework may be appropriate. The formalization constrains but doesn't determine substrate's nature.

## Conclusion

The machine-verified formalization of non-dual ontology establishes through rigorous proof that phenomena lack intrinsic essence, all phenomena are inseparable presentations of unique substrate, and phenomena arise dependently from other phenomena within that substrate. These formally proven metaphysical claims have profound implications for ethics and political philosophy, requiring reconceptualization of personhood, responsibility, rights, property, identity, violence, justice, power, community, freedom, authority, and social transformation.

For ethics, the formalization suggests that moral categories cannot be grounded in essential properties persons possess but must be understood as phenomenal-level conventions responding to real characteristics of presentations and their effects on suffering and flourishing. Responsibility arises from causal connection between agent and action rather than libertarian free will or essential agency. Rights are pragmatic conventions protecting presentations rather than essential entitlements. Harm matters because it causes real phenomenal suffering, not because it violates essential dignity.

For political philosophy, the formalization suggests that political structures and identities are phenomenal patterns arising from conditions rather than essential arrangements reflecting natural hierarchies. Authority requires consequentialist justification by effects rather than essential right to rule. Property is conventional institution serving pragmatic purposes rather than essential ownership-relation. Power-asymmetries are phenomenal patterns requiring transformation, not essential hierarchies reflecting intrinsic superiorities. Identity-categories are useful conventions for recognizing patterns and organizing action but don't correspond to essential group-natures.

The formalization's most important contribution may be establishing that social transformation is ontologically possible because arrangements lack essential unchanging nature, while also revealing that transformation requires changing conditions comprehensively and recognizing interdependence between apparently separate persons and groups. This provides both ground for political hope and framework for understanding transformation's requirements.

The unprecedented nature of this formalization is that it establishes these ontological claims through machine-verified logical proof rather than philosophical argument. The claims aren't speculative but proven to follow deductively from explicit axioms verified to be internally consistent. Ethics and political philosophy must either accommodate these formally proven metaphysical claims or demonstrate that the axioms don't correspond to reality through empirical falsification.

Whether the formalization's metaphysics is correct remains open for investigation through examining whether phenomena actually lack essential properties as predicted, whether boundaries between persons prove absolute or fluid under scrutiny, and whether treating things as essence-less presentations rather than substantial entities reduces suffering and enables flourishing. But the formalization establishes that non-dual ontology is logically coherent, can ground ethical and political thinking, and deserves serious consideration as alternative to substance-based metaphysics that has dominated Western philosophy. For ethics and political philosophy, this is not merely philosophical option but formally verified framework with rigorous logical structure requiring either acceptance or empirical refutation.
